# REAL-15 Decision Packet

REAL-17 main-CAS integration note: this document is preserved as pre-CAS-repair
historical context only. It is not forward claim-bearing on
`codex/real17-emergence-hardening-20260517`; REAL-17 must regenerate
ChainTape/CAS/verifier evidence on the updated CAS Git commit-chain baseline
before any forward claim can rely on it.

decision: `PROCEED`
label: `E3 candidate pending audit`

This packet does not claim `E3 achieved`, `E4 achieved`, `market emergence
proven`, or `market mechanism shipped`.

## Summary

REAL-15 builds and runs an executable role-differentiation verifier over the
REAL-14G and REAL-14H true-problem evidence.

The verifier reports:

```text
e3_candidate: true
verdict: PROCEED
run_count: 2
audit_tape_proceed_count: 2
persistent_active_role_count: 2
distinct_action_signature_count: 2
```

The two persistent distinct roles are:

```text
BullTrader: exact-join market action distribution, 19 BuyYes / 0 BuyNo
Solver: CAS SubmitProof role activity distribution, 34 SubmitProof outcomes
```

BearTrader adds two BuyNo actions in REAL-14H, supporting the existing
two-sided-market candidate, but is not counted as one of the two persistent
roles for E3 because it is active in only one run.

## Code And Gates

Code:

```text
src/runtime/role_differentiation.rs
src/bin/real15_role_differentiation_verifier.rs
tests/constitution_real15_role_differentiation.rs
src/runtime/mod.rs
genesis_payload.toml
```

Gates:

```text
cargo fmt --all -- --check
PASS

cargo test --test constitution_real15_role_differentiation -- --test-threads=1
6 passed / 0 failed

cargo test --test constitution_real14_e2_candidate_verifier -- --test-threads=1
8 passed / 0 failed

cargo test --lib boot::tests::verify_trust_root_passes_on_intact_repo -- --test-threads=1
PASS
```

The broad constitution runner was not treated as a VETO because its two RED
entries were linker/resource failures, not assertion failures. Both affected
tests passed when rerun sequentially with `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1`.

## Claim Boundary

Allowed:

```text
E3 candidate pending audit
```

Still forbidden:

```text
E3 achieved
E4 achieved
market emergence proven
market mechanism shipped
```

## Current Ladder State

| ladder item | status |
| --- | --- |
| E2 candidate | present |
| E2 replicated candidate | present |
| Two-sided market candidate | present |
| E3 candidate pending audit | present |
| E4 candidate pending audit | not established |
| market emergence candidate pending final audit | not established |

## Next Recommendation

Open:

```text
REAL-16 -- Market Performance / E4 Candidate Benchmark
```

The next question is whether the market mechanism improves system behavior
under pinned A/B evidence. REAL-16 must compare:

```text
A baseline market-visible
B EV scaffold
C EV + BCAST
D EV + BCAST + PnL + role-specialized action-conversion view
```

No E4 wording is allowed unless pinned A/B evidence and clean-context audit
support only:

```text
E4 candidate pending audit
```
