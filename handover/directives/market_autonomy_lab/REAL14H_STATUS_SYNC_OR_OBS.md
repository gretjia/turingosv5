# REAL-14H Status Sync / OBS

REAL-17 main-CAS integration note: this document is preserved as pre-CAS-repair
historical context only. It is not forward claim-bearing on
`codex/real17-emergence-hardening-20260517`; REAL-17 must regenerate
ChainTape/CAS/verifier evidence on the updated CAS Git commit-chain baseline
before any forward claim can rely on it.

status:
- `E2 candidate pending audit`
- `Two-sided market candidate`
- `E2 replicated candidate` for REAL-14G + REAL-14H

## Current State

REAL-14H completed a frozen REAL-14G replication run and produced stronger
candidate evidence:

```text
hard10 batch exit: 0
audit_tape: PROCEED
exact_join_count: 13
public EV basis delivery: 40/40
PolicyTrader positive EV: 29
PositiveEVIgnored: 16
action_conversion_rate_bps: 4482
buy_yes: 11
buy_no: 2
BCAST shielding: PASS
clean-context audit: PROCEED
```

## Interpretation

The current dominant bottleneck is no longer first action, replication, or side
balance. The next bottleneck is:

```text
persistent role differentiation across batches
```

## Claim Boundary

Allowed:

```text
E2 candidate pending audit
E2 replicated candidate
Two-sided market candidate
```

Not allowed:

```text
E2 achieved
E3 achieved
E4 achieved
market emergence proven
market mechanism shipped
ship evidence
```

## Next

Open:

```text
REAL-15 -- Persistent Role Differentiation / E3 Candidate Study
```
