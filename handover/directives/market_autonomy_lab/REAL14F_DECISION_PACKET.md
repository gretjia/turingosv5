# REAL-14F Decision Packet

REAL-17 main-CAS integration note: this document is preserved as pre-CAS-repair
historical context only. It is not forward claim-bearing on
`codex/real17-emergence-hardening-20260517`; REAL-17 must regenerate
ChainTape/CAS/verifier evidence on the updated CAS Git commit-chain baseline
before any forward claim can rely on it.

status: `E2 candidate pending audit`

forbidden claims: no `E2 achieved`, no `market emergence proven`, no
`market mechanism shipped`, no `E3 achieved`, no `E4 achieved`.

## Verdict

REAL-14F can be labeled:

```text
E2 candidate pending audit
```

The label is narrow. The run produced three live, non-scripted,
agent-generated BuyWithCoinRouterTx candidates by exact tx-id join, but all
three are YES-side BullTrader actions. This does not prove two-sided market
emergence, E3, E4, or ship readiness.

## Atom Status

| Atom 1 Public EV Basis Red Gates | PASS | `constitution_real13a_ev_decision_trace` red/green gates |
| Atom 2 EV Basis Stabilization | PASS | public basis delivery `38/38`, missing `0` |
| Atom 3 PolicyTrader Baseline Recovery | PASS | `policy_positive_ev_count=23`, `policy_counts_for_e2=false` |
| Atom 4 Action Conversion | PARTIAL | exact-join live buys `3`; ignored positive EV remains `20` |

| Atom 6 Hard10 True-Problem Run | PASS | batch_exit `0`, audit_tape `PROCEED` |
| Atom 7 Exact-Join / Provenance Audit | PASS with residual risk | verifier `PROCEED`; PromptCapsule link indirect via EVDecisionTrace |
| Atom 8 Clean-Context Audit | PROCEED | `REAL14F_CLEAN_CONTEXT_AUDIT.md`; candidate label only |

## Mechanism Diagnosis

R17/R18 bottleneck was missing public EV basis. REAL-14F corrected that for the
new hard10 run:

```text
ev_public_basis_available_count=38
ev_public_basis_missing_count=0
ev_public_basis_delivery_rate_bps=10000
policy_insufficient_public_basis_count=0
```

Positive EV reappeared:

```text
policy_positive_ev_count=23
policy_positive_ev_llm_abstained_count=20
exact_join_count=3
```

The next bottleneck is no longer public basis; it is voluntary action
conversion and side balance.

## Residual Risks

| Risk | Status | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| YES-side only | open | do not claim two-sided market |
| PromptCapsule direct field absent in MarketDecisionTrace | open | verifier and clean-context audit mark indirect linkage via EVDecisionTrace |
| PositiveEVIgnored remains high | open | 20 ignored positive-EV opportunities |
| Replication beyond this hard10 | open | run is a new candidate, not E2 achieved |
| Full E3/E4 evidence | absent | no role-differentiation/performance claim |

## Next Recommendation

Proceed in-envelope to REAL-14G:

```text
PositiveEVIgnored / action-conversion stabilization
```

Use the same hard10 configuration as a baseline, preserve voluntary trade, and
test only constitution-preserving mechanisms: clearer public EV summary,
ChainTape/CAS PnL scoreboard, Librarian digest of missed positive-EV patterns,
and role-specific Bull/Bear view improvements. Do not force buy/short and do
not count PolicyTrader as E2.
