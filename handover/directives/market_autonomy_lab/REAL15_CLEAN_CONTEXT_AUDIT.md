# REAL-15 Clean-Context Audit

REAL-17 main-CAS integration note: this document is preserved as pre-CAS-repair
historical context only. It is not forward claim-bearing on
`codex/real17-emergence-hardening-20260517`; REAL-17 must regenerate
ChainTape/CAS/verifier evidence on the updated CAS Git commit-chain baseline
before any forward claim can rely on it.

auditor: clean-context GPT-5.5 high
verdict: `PROCEED`
allowed_label: `REAL-15 may be labeled E3 candidate pending audit`
forbidden_label: `E3 achieved`

## Findings

No blocking findings.

The claim boundary is candidate-only: the renderer emits `E3 candidate pending
audit` plus `candidate-only; not E3 achieved`, and the materialized report has
`e3_candidate=true`, `verdict=PROCEED`, `failure_reasons=[]`.

The role activity source boundary is appropriate for candidate-only E3:
REAL-15 ingests CAS role-turn traces and E2 exact-join verifier rows, not
dashboard text.

The BearTrader one-run issue is not blocking. The verifier requires at least
two active runs when comparing two runs, then counts persistent active roles
only when `active_run_count >= 2`; the actual two persistent distinct roles are
BullTrader and Solver.

The Solver `work_count` residual is acceptable only with narrow wording.
REAL-15 counts CAS `RoleTurnOutcome::SubmitProof` as solver work, not accepted
dashboard `WorkTx`; that is sufficient for role-distribution evidence but must
not be phrased as accepted solver production.

The E2 input evidence supports the no scripted/PolicyTrader boundary: both
reports show `scripted_fixture_tx_count=0`, `policy_counts_for_e2=false`,
duplicate counts zero, shielding PASS, and PROCEED.

## Open Questions / Residual Risks

`audit_tape_proceed` is supplied to the CLI as a boolean, not read from an
audit-tape artifact in the listed inputs. This is not blocking for this audit
because the orchestrator supplied the prior audit status, but future stronger
closure should pass explicit audit evidence paths.

REAL-15 correctly surfaces upstream verifier residuals rather than hiding them.
They remain provenance-quality warnings, not candidate blockers, given upstream
E2 PROCEED.

## Verdict

```text
PROCEED
```

REAL-15 may be labeled `E3 candidate pending audit`.
