# REAL-16 Clean-Context Audit

REAL-17 main-CAS integration note: this document is preserved as pre-CAS-repair
historical context only. It is not forward claim-bearing on
`codex/real17-emergence-hardening-20260517`; REAL-17 must regenerate
ChainTape/CAS/verifier evidence on the updated CAS Git commit-chain baseline
before any forward claim can rely on it.

audit_question: `Can the combined REAL-16 ABC + recovery-D packet be labeled exactly E4 candidate pending audit?`

verdict: `PROCEED`

## Findings

The clean-context reviewer found no blocking production/verifier defect.

The reviewer confirmed that the REAL-16 verifier:

- rejects dashboard/stdout/sidecar sources,
- requires `audit_tape=PROCEED`,
- requires market-pressure arms to have E2 verifier `PROCEED`,
- checks pinned hashes,
- emits candidate boundary only on `Proceed`.

The reviewer confirmed that the combined packet has:

```text
claim_boundary = E4 candidate pending audit
verdict = Proceed
best_arm_id = D
improved_metrics =
  - wasted_attempts
  - failed_branch_count
  - ev_to_action_conversion
```

The reviewer also confirmed that:

- A is normalized to `exact_join_count=0`,
- B/C/D exact joins are 9/3/16,
- full-run D contamination is disclosed,
- recovery D has matching hashes and independent `audit_tape`/E2 verifier
  `PROCEED`.

## Residual Limitation

All arms have:

```text
solved_count = 0
verified_pput_micro = 0
```

Therefore the REAL-16 candidate rests only on narrower pressure metrics, not
solve-rate or PPUT movement.

## Reviewer Assumption

ABC plus separately recovered D is acceptable for this candidate-only audit
because the packet visibly labels D as recovery and keeps hashes pinned. A
stricter future standard may require a single uninterrupted A/B/C/D run.

## Boundary

Allowed:

```text
E4 candidate pending audit
```

Forbidden:

```text
E4 achieved
market emergence proven
market mechanism shipped
```
