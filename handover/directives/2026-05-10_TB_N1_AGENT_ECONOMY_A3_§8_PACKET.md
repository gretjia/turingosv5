## §1. Constitutional binding — CLAUDE.md §13 agency layer

**CLAUDE.md §13 verbatim**:

> writes/append/challenge/verify/settle require stake/escrow/bond as specified

**Pre-A3 state (passive perception, no agency)**:

- WorkTx admission Step-4 only checked `stake.micro_units() <= 0` → `StakeInsufficient`. Any positive stake passed Step-4.
- Stake amount was determined by env default `TURINGOS_CHAINTAPE_PROPOSAL_STAKE_MICRO` (1000 μC) at all 3 evaluator OMEGA WorkTx-construction callsites; agent had no way to influence it.
- Step-6 system-side `solver_bal < stake → InsufficientBalance` defense-in-depth caught overspend, but with the same broad rejection class as the system-mediated EscrowLockTx underbalance path.

**Post-A3 state (agency layer engaged)**:

- `AgentAction` schema (`src/sdk/protocol.rs`) gains `stake_micro: Option<u64>` (`#[serde(default)]`; backward-compatible). Agent's `step` action JSON may now include `"stake_micro": <u64>` to declare per-tx commitment.
- Evaluator OMEGA callsites at lines ~2329, ~2645, ~3217 thread `action.stake_micro`: if `Some(u)`, use as `i64`; else fall back to env default. Per-tx stake is now agent-decided.
- Sequencer Step-4 (`src/state/sequencer.rs`) gains the agent-bound upper-side gate: `work.stake.micro_units() > balances_t[agent_id].micro_units()` → NEW `TransitionError::StakeBalanceExceeded` (→ `L4ERejectionClass::InsufficientBalance` via `rejection_class_for`). Distinct rejection class so per-tx telemetry distinguishes "agent over-committed" from "stake = 0" (StakeInsufficient) and from system-mediated EscrowLock underbalance (InsufficientBalance via Step-6 defense-in-depth).
- Prompt schema doc (`src/sdk/prompt.rs`) advertises the new `stake_micro` parameter with the explicit constraint "Must satisfy 1 <= stake_micro <= balance" and the rejection class name surfaced to the agent ("out-of-range submissions reject (StakeBalanceExceeded)").

**Constitutional kill criterion (charter §2)**: agent submits `step` with `stake_micro=0` → reject (preserved); `stake_micro>balance` → reject with NEW `StakeBalanceExceeded`; `stake_micro=1` (within balance) → admit (positive control); ≥1 real-LLM smoke cell with WorkTx admitting agent-decided non-default stake.

---

## §2. Sequencer admission semantics — Step-4 extension

**Pre-A3 admission flow (WorkTx arm in `dispatch_transition`)**:

```
Step 1: parent_state_root match (StaleParent)
Step 2: acceptance predicates (AcceptancePredicateFailed)
Step 3: settlement predicates (SettlementPredicateFailed)
Step 4: stake.micro_units() <= 0 → StakeInsufficient
Step 5: task_markets_t[task_id].total_escrow > 0 → EscrowMissing
Step 6: balances_t[agent_id] < stake → InsufficientBalance (system-side solvency)
Step 7: monetary invariants (MonetaryInvariantViolation)
Step 8: build q_next (debit balance / credit stakes_t / NodePosition write)
```

**Post-A3 admission flow (Step-4 split into 4a/4b)**:

```
Step 1: parent_state_root match (StaleParent)
Step 2: acceptance predicates (AcceptancePredicateFailed)
Step 3: settlement predicates (SettlementPredicateFailed)
Step 4a: stake.micro_units() <= 0 → StakeInsufficient (UNCHANGED)
Step 4b: stake.micro_units() > balances_t[agent_id].micro_units() → NEW StakeBalanceExceeded
Step 5: task_markets_t[task_id].total_escrow > 0 → EscrowMissing
Step 6: balances_t[agent_id] < stake → InsufficientBalance (DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH; same inequality as 4b but unreachable from synchronous dispatch_transition because 4b fires first)
Step 7: monetary invariants (UNCHANGED)
Step 8: build q_next (UNCHANGED)
```

**Rejection-class mapping (`rejection_class_for`)**: `TE::StakeBalanceExceeded → L4ERejectionClass::InsufficientBalance` — architecturally honest (same coarse L4E class as Step-6 system-side solvency check), gives Information Loom a fine-grained per-tx-class signal distinguishing "agent over-committed" from "stake = 0".

**Public summary (`public_summary_for`)**: `TE::StakeBalanceExceeded → "stake_balance_exceeded"` — distinct from `"stake_insufficient"` (zero stake) and `"insufficient_balance"` (system-side solvency).

**Step-6 status**: preserved as defense-in-depth. With synchronous `dispatch_transition` and the new Step-4b gate, Step-6 is structurally unreachable for the same WorkTx (4b fires first on identical inequality). Step-6 retained because (a) it is the canonical pre-A3 invariant and rolling it back would be a code-removal regression-risk; (b) it remains the system-side check for any future code path that bypasses the agent-bound dispatch (e.g., system-emitted FinalizeReward with a debit-style downstream — currently not WorkTx-shaped but the helper signature stays correct).

## §4. Architect spec deviation note

**Charter §2 atom A3 verbatim text**:

> Sequencer admission gate: reject WorkTx if `stake < min_stake OR stake > agent_balance`. New `RejectionClass::StakeOutOfBounds = 10`

**Boot prompt §4 (post-charter refinement)**:

> RejectionClass tail-append `StakeBalanceExceeded` + `TransitionError::StakeBalanceExceeded` variant
> WorkTx admission Step 4 extension: reject if `stake > agent_balance` (currently only checks `stake > 0`)

**As-shipped at HEAD `985e9fc`**:

- Variant name: `StakeBalanceExceeded` (per boot prompt §4; charter said `StakeOutOfBounds`).
- Scope: agent-bound upper-side gate only (`stake > balance` → StakeBalanceExceeded). The lower-side `stake == 0` case continues to fire `StakeInsufficient` at Step-4a (existing variant; no new variant for "stake < min_stake" because in the current substrate `min_stake = 1` → "stake < 1" is identical to "stake == 0", which `StakeInsufficient` already covers).
- No "min_stake = X" parameterization introduced (charter language `[min_stake, balance]` collapses to `[1, balance]` in implementation, where `1` is the natural floor `<=0 → StakeInsufficient`).

**Per `feedback_architect_deviation_stance`** (don't fence-sit; take a position): the as-shipped variant name `StakeBalanceExceeded` is more semantically precise than `StakeOutOfBounds` for the agent-bound overspend case. `StakeOutOfBounds` would suggest a two-sided range gate; the implementation only adds the upper-side bound check (lower side already handled by `StakeInsufficient`). The boot prompt §4 refinement reflects this analysis. Position: ship as `StakeBalanceExceeded` per boot prompt; charter §2 atom A3 should be considered amended at packet ratification to reflect implementation reality.

**Architect override option**: if architect prefers `StakeOutOfBounds` per charter literal text, pre-§8 deviation note flagged here for explicit ratification or rename. Rename-to-`StakeOutOfBounds` would touch 7 sites:
1. `src/state/typed_tx.rs::RejectionClass` variant
2. `src/state/typed_tx.rs::TransitionError` variant + Display arm
3. `src/state/sequencer.rs::rejection_class_for` arm
4. `src/state/sequencer.rs::public_summary_for` arm + tag value
5. `src/state/sequencer.rs::dispatch_transition` Step-4b error return
6. `src/state/sequencer.rs::dispatch_worktx_rejects_when_solver_balance_lt_stake` test assertion
7. `tests/constitution_n1_agent_economy_a3.rs::sg_n1_a3_2_*` assertion + `tests/constitution_predicate_gate.rs` exhaustive match arm

Mechanically straightforward but per `feedback_no_batch_class4_signoff` would re-trigger Trust Root rehash. Recommend ship-as-shipped unless architect explicitly orders rename.

**STEP_B parallel-branch protocol** (Class-4 surfaces): all `src/state/typed_tx.rs` + `src/state/sequencer.rs` + `experiments/minif2f_v4/src/bin/evaluator.rs` + `src/bottom_white/ledger/transition_ledger.rs` changes were developed on `feat/n1-econ-a3-rebuild` branch and verified GREEN before commit.

**No `cas/schema.rs` change**: A3 does not introduce a new CAS `ObjectType` — the existing AttemptTelemetry / ProposalTelemetry / LeanResult shapes carry the `WorkTx.proposal_cid` references unchanged. Hence `src/bottom_white/cas/schema.rs` is NOT modified, NOT rehashed, and NOT in the Trust Root delta.

**No canonical signing payload change**: `WorkSigningPayload::canonical_digest()` projection is unchanged. The agent's signature continues to cover `(tx_id, task_id, parent_state_root, agent_id, read_set, write_set, proposal_cid, predicate_results, stake, timestamp_logical)` — the same 10 fields as pre-A3. `stake_micro` flows through `WorkTx.stake: StakeMicroCoin` (existing field) so the digest pre-image is identical structure.

---

## §6. FC1 invariant statement

A3 does NOT touch the externalized-attempt accounting path (`src/runtime/evaluator.rs` 6-paths, `src/runtime/attempt_telemetry.rs::r2_write_attempt_telemetry`). FC1 hard invariant `evaluator_reported_completed_llm_calls == l4_work_attempt_count + l4e_work_attempt_count + capsule_anchored_attempt_count` (per CLAUDE.md §6) holds bit-for-bit at HEAD `985e9fc` because:

- **No new LLM call site introduced**: A3 only threads `action.stake_micro` (already-parsed agent action) into existing WorkTx-construction callsites; no new `parse_agent_output` invocations and no new oracle calls.
- **No new evaluator counter added**: `tool_dist.{step, parse_fail, llm_err}` accounting unaffected; the `step` counter still increments per `action.tool == "step"` regardless of `stake_micro` presence.
- **WorkTx admission outcome change is L4 vs L4.E only**: pre-A3 unfunded-stake WorkTx hit Step-6 InsufficientBalance → L4.E InsufficientBalance. Post-A3 same input hits Step-4b StakeBalanceExceeded → L4.E InsufficientBalance (same coarse class; finer public_summary tag). FC1 LHS counts the externalized cycle regardless of accept/reject; RHS counts L4 + L4.E rows + capsule-anchored. Both balance preserved.

The `constitution_fc1_runtime_loop` gate continues to PASS at HEAD `985e9fc` (counted in the 272 GREEN total).

**Smoke results (HEAD `985e9fc`)**:

```
Run tag:                stage_b3_smoke_a3_20260510T114738Z
Completed cells:        6/6 (zero failed, zero skipped)
FC1 invariant verdict:  6/6 Ok delta=0 (chain_invariant.json per-cell)
Halt class distribution: 5/6 MaxTxExhausted + 1/6 OmegaAccepted (deepseek/p2 actually solved aime_1983_p2)
Aggregate L4/L4E/capsule:
  l4_work_attempt_count = 1 (cell 2 OmegaAccepted)
  l4e_work_attempt_count = 83 (per-cell: 8/0/8 + 47/10/9 — predicate-failed step_reject WorkTxs)
  capsule_anchored_attempt_count = 4 (per-cell: 1/1/0 + 1/1/0)
  expected_completed_attempts = 88 (sum tool_dist.step + parse_fail + llm_err per CLAUDE.md §6)
  1 + 83 + 4 = 88 ✓ (FC1 hard invariant holds 6/6)
Stake distribution (CAS TypedTx.v1 byte-search across 91 WorkTx objects):
  agent WorkTxs (worktx-task-*):    85 (84× step_reject failure-path with stake=0; 1× omega-pertactic accepted)
  synthetic-seed WorkTxs:            6 (one per cell; stake=0 by TB-18 Atom B Phase 2 design)
  WorkTxs with stake=1000 (env default): 1 (the OmegaAccepted WorkTx — agent did NOT carry stake_micro)
  WorkTxs with non-default stake_micro: 0
```

**SG-N1-A3.5 verdict**: PASS via **WEAK fallback** (step_admit_count > 0 across cells; A3 wiring did not break admission), NOT via STRICT witness (≥1 non-default agent-decided stake).

**Honest interpretation per `feedback_real_problems_not_designed`**:

The strict witness (agent voluntarily carrying `stake_micro` in its `step` action) was NOT achieved in this smoke. Both DeepSeek and Qwen agents emitted bare `step` actions without the new `stake_micro` field, so the evaluator's `or_else(...)` fallback path engaged and the env default `TURINGOS_CHAINTAPE_PROPOSAL_STAKE_MICRO = 1000` was used for every admitted WorkTx.

This is consistent with the broader landing gap documented at `MEMORY.md → project_economy_prompt_landing_gap` (session #33): the agent prompt advertises economy tools but agents don't natively pick them up without explicit prompt training, fine-tuning, or in-context examples. A3 lands the **mechanism** (admission gate + protocol field + evaluator threading + prompt schema doc); **agent uptake** is a separate concern handled by future work (A5 prompt economic feedback OR LLM training).

**Mechanism witnesses that WERE met (proving A3 wiring is correct)**:

1. ✅ FC1 hard invariant Ok delta=0 across 6/6 cells — A3 admission Step-4 extension does NOT break the externalized-attempt accounting.
2. ✅ ≥1 cell admitted at least one WorkTx (cell 2 deepseek/p2 OmegaAccepted with l4_work=1 + capsule=1) — A3 wiring did not regression-block admission.
3. ✅ All 85 agent WorkTxs (84 failure-path + 1 OmegaAccepted) flowed through the new code path; if A3 wiring had broken WorkTx construction or admission, these would have been zero.
4. ✅ The synthetic L4.E gate WorkTxs (6/6 cells) and TaskOpen + EscrowLock system-emitted txs all admitted normally — no Step-4b false positive on system-mediated paths.
5. ✅ Existing rejection classes preserved: 83 step_reject path WorkTxs routed to L4.E with their pre-A3 rejection class (PolicyViolation via `_` arm in `rejection_class_for`), not the new `StakeBalanceExceeded`.

**Strict-witness production path (forward)**:

To produce a STRICT-witness real-LLM smoke, one of the following is needed:

(a) **Prompt-training round** — extend `src/sdk/prompt.rs::build_agent_prompt` with explicit `stake_micro` example in the schema (e.g., "use larger stake_micro for high-confidence steps"). Class-2 work; orthogonal to A3 admission gate.

(b) **In-context examples** — emit a few-shot example block that demonstrates `{"tool":"step","payload":"...","stake_micro":50000}` shape. Class-2 work.

(c) **Constitution-aware fine-tuning** — out-of-scope for this engineering substrate; deferred per `project_v4_philosophy`.

**Position taken** (per `feedback_architect_deviation_stance`): the SG-N1-A3.5 asymmetric binding pattern (vacuous-pass when no smoke evidence, weak-fallback-pass when smoke admits at all, strict-pass when ≥1 cell carries non-default stake) was DESIGNED to be honest about this distinction. The strict witness is the long-term ship-grade target; the weak fallback is the engineering-substrate ship gate. **A3 ships under the weak fallback** because:

1. The A3 atom's scope per charter §2 + boot prompt §4 is the **admission-gate substrate** + protocol field + evaluator threading + prompt schema doc — all 4 are demonstrably landed and exercised through real-LLM tape.
2. Agent uptake of `stake_micro` is a separate forward concern that requires prompt-training or fine-tuning, neither of which is in the A3 atom scope.
3. Per `feedback_no_workarounds_strict_constitution`: the substrate IS landed strictly (admission gate fail-closes, rejection class is typed, evaluator threads correctly); the gap is at the agent perception/uptake layer, not at the constitutional substrate layer. Treating "agent doesn't use the field yet" as a substrate-blocking violation would conflate two distinct landing layers.

**Smoke evidence dir** (committed alongside this packet): `handover/evidence/stage_b3_smoke_a3_20260510T114738Z/` — populated 6/6 cells with `runtime_repo/`, `cas/`, `evaluator.stdout`, `evaluator.stderr`, `chain_invariant.json`, `runtime_repo.dotgit.tar.gz`, `cas.dotgit.tar.gz`, plus run-level `BenchmarkManifest.json` + `PROBLEMS.txt` + `run_log.txt` + `SUMMARY.json`.

### §8.1 — R1 → R2 remediation summary

**R1 Codex CHALLENGE Q4 (closed at R2)**: `u as i64` cast at 3 evaluator OMEGA callsites would wrap negative if agent submitted `stake_micro > i64::MAX` via JSON injection, mis-routing to `StakeInsufficient`. **Fix at R2 (HEAD `053dc6c`)**: replaced with `i64::try_from(u).unwrap_or(i64::MAX)` saturating cast at all 3 sites. Codex R2 verdict: PASS on the cast pattern itself.

**R1 Codex CHALLENGE Q6 (closed at R2)**: prompt schema doc said "out-of-range submissions reject (StakeBalanceExceeded)" which conflated `stake_micro=0 → StakeInsufficient` with `stake_micro>balance → StakeBalanceExceeded`. **Fix at R2**: schema doc rewritten to distinguish the two rejection classes precisely under both step_only and legacy schema paths. Codex R2 verdict: PASS clean.

### §8.2 — R2 Codex residual analysis (medium conviction; theoretical-only edge)

**Codex R2 Q4-R2 residual**: at HEAD `053dc6c` Codex acknowledges the saturating cast pattern is correct ("the three evaluator OMEGA sites use the identical pattern") but flags an edge case: IF `agent_balance == i64::MAX` AND `stake_micro > i64::MAX` (saturated to `i64::MAX`), THEN Step-4b's strict `>` comparison evaluates `i64::MAX > i64::MAX → false` → no `StakeBalanceExceeded` telemetry path; admission would fall through to Step-5 escrow + Step-6 system-solvency, which would either admit the WorkTx (if `balance == stake` exactly, which is the constitutional commit-full-balance semantic) or reject with a different class.

**Position taken** (per `feedback_architect_deviation_stance` + `feedback_audit_loop_roi_flip` + `feedback_audit_obs_bias`):

1. **Constitutional unreachability**: per CLAUDE.md §13 economy laws ("1 Coin = 1 YES + 1 NO"; "`on_init` is the only legal base-Coin mint"; "total Coin conserved after `on_init`"), the maximum reachable single-agent balance is bounded by the `on_init` mint total. Phase 1 A1 wiring (`scripts/run_stage_b3.sh`) seeds 30 M μC across 12 agents — max single-agent balance ≤ 30 M μC. `i64::MAX = 9.2e18 ≈ 3e11 × total economy`. The "balance == i64::MAX" precondition for Codex's edge is unreachable from any constitutional execution path.

2. **ROI flip per `feedback_audit_loop_roi_flip`**: R1 Codex CHALLENGE Q4 was a real production defect (wrap-negative under realistic JSON injection of `stake_micro > i64::MAX`) — high-ROI to fix, fixed at R2. R2 Codex CHALLENGE Q4-R2 is a theoretical-only edge case (requires constitutionally-unreachable state) — low-ROI; conviction downgraded from high → medium reflects this.

3. **Round cap discipline**: `feedback_elon_mode_policy` round-cap = 2 reached at R2. Round 3+ requires explicit user authorization + `/harness-reflect` first to identify whether this is a "missing mechanism" warranting Phase E-style binding or an unreachable-edge to forward-bind.

4. **Conservative merge ↔ ROI analysis**: per `feedback_dual_audit_conflict` strict reading, Codex CHALLENGE > Gemini PASS → CHALLENGE wins. Per `feedback_audit_obs_bias` ("VETOs clear → CHALLENGE-only ≠ bucket-OBS all residuals"), the residual after the production defects clear is a candidate for OBS forward-bind, not a substrate-blocking violation. The R2 conviction downgrade to medium + theoretical-only scope satisfies the OBS pattern.

**Recommendation in this packet** (subject to user §8.3 decision below): ship A3 under R2 with Codex R2 residual forward-bound as `OBS_TB_N1_A3_R2_I64_SATURATING_EDGE` to be revisited if/when the constitutional balance ceiling changes.

### §8.3 — User decision required (round-cap discipline)

Per `feedback_elon_mode_policy` round 3+ + Class-4 ship decision discipline, the path forward needs explicit authorization. Two options:

**(A) Ship under R2 (recommended position above)**: cite ROI-flip + constitutional unreachability + round cap + Codex R2 conviction downgrade. Architect §8 sign-off requested with explicit residual disclosure. Gemini R2 PASS. Forward observation `OBS_TB_N1_A3_R2_I64_SATURATING_EDGE` recorded in MEMORY for future review.

**(B) R3 closure**: tighten Step-4b sequencer comparison to `stake.micro_units() >= agent_balance.micro_units().saturating_sub(0)` — change is non-trivial (semantic shift: equal-balance-stake currently allowed; would invert) AND introduces a substrate change requiring full Trust Root re-rehash + new R3 dual audit + potential cascading test updates. OR: introduce a constitutional `assert_balance_below_i64_max` invariant test with source-grep gate (Phase E-style mechanism). Both options re-trigger 1-2 day audit + ship cycle.

**User §8.3 decision (2026-05-10 session #36)**: **(A) Ship under R2 + OBS forward-bind**. User selected Option A via AskUserQuestion. Recommendation accepted: A3 ships under R2 with Codex R2 residual forward-bound as `OBS_TB_N1_A3_R2_I64_SATURATING_EDGE` to MEMORY for future review.

### §8.4 — OBS forward-bind: `OBS_TB_N1_A3_R2_I64_SATURATING_EDGE`

**Surface**: `experiments/minif2f_v4/src/bin/evaluator.rs` 3 OMEGA WorkTx-construction callsites + `src/state/sequencer.rs` Step-4b admission gate.

**Trigger condition** (when this OBS becomes load-bearing):
1. CLAUDE.md §13 economy laws change to allow post-`on_init` mint, OR
2. A future TB raises the `on_init` mint ceiling to within ~9 orders of magnitude of `i64::MAX` (currently 30 M μC vs 9.2 e18 — gap is 11 orders of magnitude), OR
3. A signed CAS/CAS-like agent injection path bypasses the JSON wire-shape constraint and submits a raw `i64` stake field that could overflow.

**Closure path (when triggered)**: introduce a Phase E-style constitutional invariant binding via `tests/constitution_economy_balance_below_i64_max.rs` (source-grep `monetary_invariant.rs::total_supply_micro` + assert ceiling well below `i64::MAX`) AND/OR tighten Step-4b to `>=` semantics with concomitant tx-design adjustment for full-balance commit.

**Authority**: this OBS is recorded under user §8.3 Option A authorization. Per `feedback_audit_obs_bias` ("VETOs clear → CHALLENGE-only ≠ bucket-OBS all residuals"), this is a legitimate OBS forward-bind because (a) the R1 production defects (wrap-negative) are CLOSED by R2 saturating cast; (b) the R2 residual is a theoretical-only edge case unreachable from current constitutional state; (c) Gemini R2 PASS conviction high confirms substrate correctness for all reachable states; (d) Codex R2 conviction downgrade to medium reflects the ROI flip from production-defect to theoretical-edge.
