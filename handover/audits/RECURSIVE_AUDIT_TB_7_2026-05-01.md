# Recursive self-audit — TB-7 (Per-LLM-Proposal WorkTx Routing / Frame B)

**Date**: 2026-05-01
**Diff range**: `05c5be7..9e74195` (Atom 7 ship). The actual diff range
contains **11 commits** (`git log --format=%H 05c5be7..9e74195` enumeration:
`9e74195 / 2559c84 / 4cfe7cb / d03814f / 3572141 / 2bc879c / 0414b30 / eed4837
/ c3ad31e / 48c02e2 / cc7b3dd`). The original prompt said 9 commits — that
was a mental count of charter atoms (0/0.5/1/1.5/1.7/2/3/4/5/6/7 = 11 atoms,
some collapsed in commits). Codex audit 492e86c §2 action #5 flagged the
9-vs-11 mismatch; this metadata correction is the carry-forward fix.
**Atoms shipped**: 0 / 0.5 / 1 / 1.5 / 1.7 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / 7
**Workspace test count**: 686 PASSED / 0 FAILED / 150 IGNORED at Atom 7 ship; 686
preserved through TB-7.5 audit-driven fixes (action #1 fail-closed
authoritative path + action #2 proposal_count includes L4.E)
**Audit class**: Class 2 (production wire-up)
**Mode**: recursive self-audit; Codex impl audit launches as Atom 7 follow-up after this doc commits.

---

## §0 Headline verdict

**TB-7 is READY TO SHIP** with structural Frame B closure on the synthetic-LLM
end-to-end pipeline. Real-LLM smoke (mathd_algebra_107 with live DeepSeek +
Lean) is a documented manual carry-forward.

**3 of 7** Codex audit (cc7b3dd) action items FULLY CLOSED at ship (#1 #2 #3);
**4 of 7** are PARTIAL and roll to a follow-up TB per §13.4 anti-pile-up rule
(#4 #5 #6 #7). TB-6 audit-pending status REMAINS OPEN. (Corrected by TB-7.5
audit fix per Codex audit 492e86c action #3 — earlier "5/7 closed" was a
top-line miscount that contradicted the detailed §3 mapping; §3 was always
correct.)

```
Frame A (TB-6):                     GREEN (already closed at TB-6 ship)
Frame B authoritative path (D1):    GREEN (Atoms 2 + 3)
Frame B run-local identity (D2):    GREEN (Atom 1)
Frame B narrowed OMEGA (D3):        GREEN (Atom 3)
Frame B ChainDerivedRunFacts (D4):  GREEN (Atom 5)
Frame B production wire-up (D5):    GREEN (Atom 1.5 + Atoms 2/3 wiring)
Gate 1 (authoritative path):        GREEN
Gate 2 (proposal count equality):   GREEN structurally; real-LLM run = manual
Gate 3 (≥1 L4 + ≥1 L4.E):           GREEN (smoke evidence: 1 L4 + 6 L4.E)
Gate 4 (signature verification):    GREEN
Gate 5 (CAS retrievability):        GREEN
Gate 6 (chain-derived run facts):   GREEN
Gate 7 (legacy-bypass regression):  GREEN (3/3 conformance tests pass)
```

  as manual procedure; environment-specific carry-forward

### Atom 7 — Audit + ship (THIS COMMIT)
- ✅ tests/tb_7_legacy_append_regression.rs (Gate 7 conformance test)
- ✅ This recursive self-audit doc
- ⏭ Codex impl audit on full TB-7 diff: launches after this commit

## §2 7-gate closure check

| Gate | Requirement | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `bus.submit_typed_tx` is authoritative; no legacy `bus.append` as authoritative state mutation | charter §4.0 + Gate 7 conformance test | GREEN |
| 2 | `chain_proposal_count == evaluator_proposal_count` | smoke evidence chain_derived_run_facts.json (synthetic); real-LLM = manual | GREEN structurally |
| 3 | ≥1 accepted L4 + ≥1 rejected L4.E (forced rejection labeled) | smoke evidence: 1 L4 (TaskOpen accepted) + 6 L4.E (zero-stake WorkTx + VerifyTx rejected); natural rejections | GREEN |
| 4 | All WorkTx + system tx signatures verify | replay_report.json: agent_signatures_verified + system_signatures_verified BOTH true | GREEN |
| 5 | Every WorkTx.proposal_cid resolves to CAS ProposalTelemetry | replay_report.json: proposal_telemetry_cas_retrievable=true | GREEN |
| 6 | ChainDerivedRunFacts == evaluator structural facts on §4.4 set | I110 round-trip test asserts tx_count + L4.E + tactic_diversity equality | GREEN structurally |
| 7 | Repo-wide regression: no proposal-producing site uses legacy append authoritatively | tests/tb_7_legacy_append_regression.rs (3/3 tests pass) | GREEN |

## §3 TB-6 audit-pending closure path (§13.4 mapping table)

| Codex action | Charter mapping | Closure status |
|---|---|---|
| #1 fail-closed bootstrap | Atom 1.7 (b) | **CLOSED** at Atom 1.7 |
| #2 real proposal/OMEGA/rejection through typed ChainTape | Atom 2 + Atom 3 (§4.0) | **CLOSED** structurally; real-LLM = manual |
| #3 AgentProposalRecord schema repair (logical_t) | Atom 1.7 (a) | **CLOSED** at Atom 1.7 (I91e structural witness) |
| #4 audit-index row hash from CAS | Atom 4 expansion | PARTIAL — agent-signature path covered; full audit-index hash recompute is Atom 7 conformance carry-forward |
| #5 strict RunSummary tx_id ↔ CID ↔ AgentProposalRecord | Atom 5 expansion | PARTIAL — chain_derived_run_facts enforces ProposalTelemetry CAS resolution; full RunSummary cross-check is Atom 7 conformance carry-forward |
| #6 disk-level tamper tests (CAS / Git L4 / derivative roots / pinned pubkeys) | Atom 4 expansion (I90d/e/f/g) | PARTIAL — Gate 4 covers signature tampering; I90d/e/f/g full battery is Atom 7 conformance carry-forward |
| #7 regenerate TB-6 smoke evidence | Atom 6 (chain-backed real-LLM smoke) | PARTIAL — synthetic-LLM smoke evidence regenerated at Atom 6; real-LLM smoke = manual carry-forward |

**Verdict on TB-6 audit-pending status**:

- 3/7 action items FULLY CLOSED at TB-7 ship (#1, #2, #3).
- 4/7 action items PARTIALLY CLOSED: structural witness in place;
  expanded conformance battery + real-LLM run remain as manual carry-forward.

Per §13.4 anti-pile-up rule: "If any of the 7 action items remains red at
TB-7 Atom 7 ship, **TB-6 audit-pending status remains open** and the
carry-forward rolls to a follow-up TB."

**TB-6 audit-pending status remains OPEN** at TB-7 ship. The 4 partial
items roll to a follow-up TB. This is honest accounting — TB-7 closes the
*structural* part of the gap (authoritative path + chain-derived run facts +
agent signatures + ProposalTelemetry CAS); the *full conformance battery*
(I90d/e/f/g + audit-index hash recompute + strict RunSummary cross-check +
real-LLM smoke supersession) is a follow-up TB.

## §4 Forbidden-list audit (charter §6)

Inherits TB-6 §6 #1-20. Atom 7 audit:

- ✅ #21 No FinalizeRewardTx wiring — verified: no `FinalizeRewardTx` in
  evaluator.rs Atom 2 / 3 hot paths.
- ✅ #22 No SlashTx wiring — verified: no `SlashTx` in evaluator hot paths.
- ✅ #23 No NodeMarket position semantics — verified: no NodePosition /
  NodeMarketEntry in TB-7 surface.
- ✅ #24 No new TypedTx variant — verified: only existing WorkTx + VerifyTx
  used; no schema additions.
- ✅ #25 No Q schema mutation — verified: agent_pubkeys.json is sidecar
  manifest, not in QState.
- ✅ #26 No agent chain-of-thought broadcast — verified: AgentProposalRecord
  shape unchanged + I91d/I91e + ProposalTelemetry forbidden-field guard.
- ✅ #27 No bypassing TB-6 chaintape gate — verified: every Atom produces
  chain-backed evidence + verify_chaintape PASS.
- ✅ #28 No regression on Atom 5/6 hooks — verified with caveat: Atom 1.7
  logical_t removal is forward fix to architect spec, not regression
  (per §6 #28 caveat).
- ✅ #29 No claim of Frame C closure — verified: TB-7 ships at Frame B only.
- ✅ #30 No Codex-only ship without `degraded` Gemini label — applies at
  Atom 7 ship audit (next commit).
- ✅ #31 No legacy bus.append as authoritative — verified by Gate 7
  conformance test (3/3 pass).
- ✅ #32 No "chain-derived PPUT" mis-naming — verified: module renamed to
  `chain_derived_run_facts`; all references updated.
- ✅ #33 No forced rejection masquerading — verified: smoke evidence
  rejections are natural (zero-stake WorkTx → StakeInsufficient). No
  `forced_rejection_for_gate_3` label needed.

## §5 Charter §4 decision blocks audit (D1-D5 binding amendments)

- ✅ D1 (authoritative path): §4.0 NEW; §5.1 evaluator row rewritten;
  Atoms 2 + 3 wire authoritative routing; legacy append annotated
  shadow_only or removed.
- ✅ D2 (run-local keypair caveat): §4.2 amended; Atom 1
  AgentKeypairRegistry shipped with caveat in module docstring.
- ✅ D3 (OMEGA narrowed scope): §4.3 confirmed; Atom 3 emits WorkTx +
  VerifyTx pair only; ChallengeWindow OPEN; no FinalizeRewardTx; no
  SlashTx.
- ✅ D4 (ChainDerivedRunFacts rename): §4.4 rewritten; Atom 5 module
  renamed; bit-exact field set documented.
- ✅ D5 (ProposalTelemetry CAS): §4.5 NEW; Atom 1.5 module shipped;
  Gate 5 wired in Atom 4 verify_chaintape.

---

## §6 Three success proofs / 7 ship gates audit (charter §8)

§8 was rewritten at Atom 0.5 to replace the 3-proof draft with 7 ship
gates. All 7 gates GREEN per §2 above.

---

## §7 What's NOT in this audit (deferred)

1. **Codex impl audit on full TB-7 diff**: launched as Atom 7 follow-up
   immediately after this self-audit commits. Verdict feeds the final
   TB-7 ship report.

2. **Gemini arch audit**: degraded fallback per `feedback_dual_audit`
   (Gemini strategic-tier MODEL_CAPACITY_EXHAUSTED at TB-5 supplement
   precedent). Ship report carries `audit_label: degraded`.

3. **Real-LLM smoke run on mathd_algebra_107**: documented as manual
   procedure in `tests/tb_7_atom6_chain_backed_smoke.rs` header.
   Environment-specific (DeepSeek API + Lean exe + Mathlib cache).

4. **TB-6 audit-pending closure**: REMAINS OPEN per §3 above; 4 partial
   action items roll to follow-up TB.

5. **kernel.tape view materialization from L4**: TB-7 ships with
   `// shadow_only:` annotated bus.append calls. Full closure (kernel.tape
   derived from L4) is a post-MVP refactor; charter §4.0 option (3) status
   recorded honestly.

---

## §8 Self-audit verdict

**TB-7 RECURSIVELY GREEN at the structural level.** Frame B authoritative
routing closure achieved; 7 ship gates GREEN (Gate 2 + Gate 6 structurally
green; full real-LLM round-trip is manual carry-forward).

TB-6 audit-pending status REMAINS OPEN with 4 partial action items
rolling to a follow-up TB.

**Ship recommendation**: SHIP TB-7 with the `degraded` Gemini-arch audit
label and explicit closure-path documentation in §3. Codex impl audit on
full TB-7 diff to follow this self-audit commit.
