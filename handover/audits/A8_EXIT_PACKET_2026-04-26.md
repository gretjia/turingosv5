# Phase A → B Exit Audit Packet (A8) — current-state snapshot

**Arc**: PPUT-CCL (`PREREG_PPUT_CCL_2026-04-26.md` round-4 PASS/PASS + `PREREG_AMENDMENT_p0_defer_2026-04-25.md`).
**Date**: 2026-04-26.
**Authority**: ArchitectAI commit (Art. V.1.2). Input to dual external audit (Codex + Gemini) per Art. V.1.3 + memory `feedback_dual_audit`.

**Decision rule**: PASS → Phase B (kernel instrumentation + PPUT accounting) authorized; CHALLENGE → in-cycle fixes; VETO → Phase A redesign.

**FC-trace**: meta-witness across FC1 / FC2 / FC3 (atoms instrument all three subgraphs).

**Document split**: this packet is the **stable current-state snapshot** of Phase A at exit — it describes WHAT IS, not how it got here. The chronological history of audit rounds + their in-cycle fix bundles lives in the **companion** document `handover/audits/A8_AUDIT_HISTORY_2026-04-26.md` (append-only). Past audit transcripts are at `handover/audits/{CODEX,GEMINI}_PHASE_A8_EXIT_AUDIT_2026-04-26{,_R2,_R3,_R4,_R5,_R6,_R7,...}.md`. Reviewers needing closure-of-prior-finding context read the history doc; reviewers verifying current-state correctness against Phase B prerequisites read THIS packet.

## § 1. Phase A scope and atom map

Phase A = pre-flight (days 1–3 of the 30-day arc). Decomposed into 8 atoms (A0–A7); atom A8 is the dual external audit gate represented by this packet.

- **A0** (a–e): harness modernization.
- **A1**: PREREG amendment p_0 calibration deferral.
- **A2**: P0a `swarm_N=1` mode + `parse_swarm_condition_n` unit tests.
- **A3**: per-agent `AGENT_MODELS` env var (Phase B+C single-model invariant gate).
- **A4**: decomposed metrics (`hit_max_tx` + `tactic_diversity` + `verifier_wait_ms`).
- **A5**: per-agent budget normalization (`BUDGET_REGIME` + `MAX_TRANSACTIONS`).
- **A6**: per-line FC tagging via structured JSON events (`fc_trace` module).
- **A7**: SiliconFlow heterogeneous-LLM provider plumbing (proxy + 3-key smoke).
- **A8**: this packet — Phase A → B exit audit.

## § 3. Per-atom acceptance evidence (current state)

### A0 (harness modernization) — `62c4e14`
- 4 governance rules (R-014 / R-015 / R-018 / R-019), constitution-special-case judge.sh hook (R-016 fc_trace_in_commit), `tests/fc_alignment_conformance.rs` 17-witness battery + 9 ignored stubs, 5 cases C-071..C-075 (constitution amendment process / Veto-AI scope / ArchitectAI commit authority / FC-first / DO-178C tool qualification).
- Closed by dual-audit cycle; no open P0.

### A1 (PREREG amendment) — `6be6eb4`
- File: `handover/preregistration/PREREG_AMENDMENT_p0_defer_2026-04-25.md`.
- Substitutes `p_0 = 0.10` (PREREG § 5.5 ceiling) for the calibration-derived value at every Gate H consumer.
- **Statistical framing**: `0.10` is the **least-strict admissible value** the PREREG ceiling allows. `j-RR ≤ p_0` makes a SMALLER `p_0` stricter, so this substitution is operationally permitted but is NOT a tighter-than-original guarantee. No Type-I inflation since `j-RR` is descriptive (PREREG § 5.4), outside the inferential family. The substitution is operationally permitted at any phase including Phase E; if/when § 3 re-calibration conditions complete, calibration upgrades the bar.
- **FC-trace**: FC1-N12 + Art. V.1.2 + cases C-073 + C-075.

### A2 (`swarm_N=1` mode) — `180a300`
- New `parse_swarm_condition_n` in `experiments/minif2f_v4/src/bin/evaluator.rs` discriminates `n<digits>` from `oneshot` / `hybrid_v1` / malformed. PREREG_AMENDMENT § 3 condition 2 cleared.
- **FC-trace**: FC2-N16 + FC1-N11.
- 5 unit tests.

### A3 (`AGENT_MODELS` env var) — `7f4bc0c`
- New `experiments/minif2f_v4/src/agent_models.rs`. Pure parser + expander + env-coupled resolver. Heterogeneity gated by `PHASE_D_HETERO_OK=1` — Phase B+C single-model invariant enforced at startup BEFORE any LLM call.
- **FC-trace**: FC1-N7 (δ/AI canonical identity per Agent_i).
- 11 unit tests.

### A4 (decomposed metrics) — `a5c78e4`
- 3 non-Optional v2 fields on `RunAggregate` + legacy `PputResult`: `hit_max_tx`, `tactic_diversity`, `verifier_wait_ms`. Helper `compute_tactic_diversity`.
- **FC-trace**: FC2-N22 + FC1-N11 + FC1-N12.
- 5 conformance tests.

### A5 (budget regime) — `30f2a14`
- New `experiments/minif2f_v4/src/budget_regime.rs`. 4-variant `BudgetRegime` enum: `total_proposal` (default; preserves the prior baseline) / `per_agent` (loop bound = base × N) / `token_total` (declared; startup-fatal `UnimplementedRegime`) / `wall_clock` (declared; startup-fatal). 2 new non-Optional v2 fields: `budget_regime` + `budget_max_transactions`.
- `run_swarm` startup: env-resolved budget with startup-fatal error path on misconfiguration.
- **FC-trace**: FC2-N22 + FC1-N7.
- 16 unit tests; PREREG_AMENDMENT § 3 condition 3 cleared.

### A6 (FC tracing) — `89994c7`
- New `experiments/minif2f_v4/src/fc_trace.rs`. Pure stdlib (zero new deps). 7-variant `FcId` enum (FC1-N7 / FC1-N11 / FC1-N12 / FC1-E18 / FC2-N20 / FC2-N22 / FC3-N31). `FC_TRACE=1` gate cached in `OnceLock`; `FC_TRACE_FILE=<path>` redirects emit to file.
- **9 wired anchor sites** (8 in `run_swarm` + 1 in `run_oneshot`):
  - FC2-N22 synthetic short-circuit (swarm)
  - FC2-N20 mr tick (swarm)
  - FC2-N22 OMEGA full-proof accept (swarm)
  - FC2-N22 OMEGA per-tactic accept (swarm)
  - FC2-N22 natural MaxTxExhausted (swarm; carries `budget_regime` payload)
  - FC1-N12 verify bracket (oneshot)
  - FC1-N12 swarm `verify_omega_detailed` path "alone"
  - FC1-N12 swarm `verify_omega_detailed` path "tape+payload"
  - FC1-N12 swarm `verify_partial`
- Per-run correlation: `experiments/minif2f_v4/src/run_id.rs::mint_run_id` mints one identifier per run, threaded into both `emit_event` and `make_pput` so FC events join v2 jsonl rows by equality.
- **FC-trace**: meta-witness for the 5-step compile loop.
- 7 tests on `fc_trace` (6 unit + 1 end-to-end smoke `tests/fc_trace_smoke.rs` exercising `FC_TRACE=1` in a child process). 3 unit tests on `run_id`.

### A7 (SiliconFlow plumbing) — `90953d6`
- `src/drivers/llm_proxy.py`: OpenAI-compatible local HTTP server with per-provider multi-key round-robin. `detect_provider()` routing matrix:
  - explicit `provider:...` prefix → that provider (if known)
  - any slash-form id (HuggingFace style: `Qwen/...`, `openai/...`, `meta-llama/...`, `deepseek-ai/...`) → `siliconflow`
  - bare `"deepseek"` substring (no slash) → `deepseek` (api.deepseek.com)
  - bare `qwen3-*` / `qwen-*` (no slash) → `dashscope`
  - else → `dashscope` (default fallback)
- 3 SiliconFlow keys (primary / secondary / tertiary) split concurrent traffic across separate rate-limit pools — V3L-27 / case C-027 single-key N=30 collapse mitigation.
- `scripts/smoke_siliconflow.sh` + `_smoke_siliconflow.py`: 3 keys × 1 probe (Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, max_tokens=8). Verified all 3 keys responding.
- `scripts/test_llm_proxy.py`: 16-test routing + round-robin conformance suite (no live API). Wrapped by `experiments/minif2f_v4/tests/llm_proxy_python_conformance.rs` so the suite runs on every `cargo test --workspace`. The wrapper FAILS CLOSED if `python3` is missing; explicit opt-out `SKIP_LLM_PROXY_PYTHON_CONFORMANCE=1` (logged loudly).
- **FC-trace**: FC1-N7 (δ/AI provider expansion).
- Memory: `reference_siliconflow.md` records SiliconFlow as the Phase D heterogeneous lane (NOT a probe-only target).

## § 4. Phase B → C exit checklist (from PREREG_AMENDMENT § 4) — Phase A side

The PREREG amendment shifted the Phase B → C gate. From the Phase A perspective, the items it lists are now satisfied:

- ❌ p_0 calibration jsonl frozen (was REQUIRED) → **DEFERRED with substitution per amendment § 2**: `p_0 = 0.10` hardcoded at every Gate H consumer.
- ✅ B1–B7 + B7-extra mode toggle infrastructure complete (pre-Phase A baseline; round-4 PASS/PASS).
- ✅ Phase A0 harness modernization complete (`62c4e14`).
- ✅ Tools qualified per case C-075 (DO-178C tool qualification): `runner.sh`, `compute_p0.py`, evaluator boot enforcement, etc.
- ✅ Trust Root verifies clean (`boot::tests::verify_trust_root_passes_on_intact_repo` PASS at 38-entry manifest with recursive child-manifest verification per A8e13 Q1).

## § 5. Risks and known limitations entering Phase B

1. **`per_agent` budget regime untested at runtime**. A5 unit tests verify the scaling math (`base × N`) and env-coupled resolver. No live-LLM run with `BUDGET_REGIME=per_agent` has been smoked. Phase B kernel instrumentation will be the first opportunity to observe its behavior on a real problem.
2. **FC-trace coverage still partial**. 9 wired anchor sites cover HALT decomposition (FC2-N22 × 4 exit paths) + mr tick (FC2-N20) + Lean oracle scope (FC1-N12 × 4 sites: oneshot + swarm `verify_omega_detailed` × 2 + swarm `verify_partial`). Still NOT emitting: FC1-N7 prompt-build, FC1-N11 ∏p decision diversity (per-proposal), FC1-E18 preserve-Q_t (per ∏p=0), FC3-N31 WAL append. The `FcId` enum reserves these variants. Phase B+ kernel instrumentation should fill them in as the Phase B emit boundary lands.
3. **SiliconFlow rate-limit at scale**. A7 verified 3 keys responding individually at N=1 concurrency. V3L-27 demonstrates collapse at N=30 single-key. The v4 multi-key round-robin should triple the safe N envelope but the actual sweet spot for our hetero swarm is unmeasured. Phase D heterogeneous-batch design should land a `--max-concurrency` knob (currently `LLM_PROXY_CONCURRENCY=5` env in proxy) tuned per provider.
4. **Heterogeneous swarm = Phase D, not B/C**. Per F-2026-04-25-02 + the `agent_models.rs` `PHASE_D_HETERO_GATE_ENV_VAR` invariant, Phases B and C MUST stay single-model so ablation axes are not confounded. A7's plumbing exists for future Phase D work; Phase B uses the existing `deepseek-v4-flash` thinking-off backbone unchanged.
5. **`make_pput` arity = 24 (Phase B+ refactor)**. The positional-arg list is a maintainability hazard; refactor to builder pattern (`PputResultBuilder`) recommended early in Phase B. Non-blocking; runtime correctness verified by 4 in-binary tests + the integration battery.

## § 6. Specific questions for auditors

(All prior-round questions and their closures are recorded in `A8_AUDIT_HISTORY_2026-04-26.md` — see that doc's chronological round-N entries for the current count + verdicts. The questions below are for the current-round reviewer pass.)

### Q1 — Code correctness spot-checks
- (Q1.a) Does `experiments/minif2f_v4/src/bin/evaluator.rs` mint a single `run_id` at function entry and pass it to BOTH `fc_trace::emit_event` and `make_pput` so FC events and v2 jsonl rows share one identifier? Verify by reading `run_swarm` and `run_oneshot` entry points + `make_pput` signature.
- (Q1.b) Does `src/drivers/llm_proxy.py::detect_provider` route `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B` to `siliconflow` (not `deepseek`)? Verify by reading the function + checking that `scripts/test_llm_proxy.py` includes `test_deepseek_slash_form_routes_to_siliconflow`.
- (Q1.c) Does `experiments/minif2f_v4/tests/llm_proxy_python_conformance.rs` fail closed when `python3` is missing? Verify by reading the test source (appended to this packet) + checking that the panic message describes the failure rather than a silent skip.

### Q2 — PREREG amendment soundness
- (Q2.a) `p_0 = 0.10` substitution wording: is `PREREG_AMENDMENT_p0_defer_2026-04-25.md` § 2 + § 8 internally consistent + statistically correct (least-strict admissible; no Type-I inflation; substitution operative at any phase including Phase E)?
- (Q2.b) Re-calibration conditions in § 3 are PRE-REQUISITES for calibration to run, not guarantees that calibration completes before any specific phase. Is this framed correctly without claiming calibration MUST run before Phase E?
- (Q2.c) The amendment's SHA-256 is in Trust Root. Does `boot::tests::verify_trust_root_passes_on_intact_repo` pass cleanly?

### Q3 — Atomicity, FC-trace discipline, governance
- (Q3.a) Each of A1–A7 was committed as one atomic commit with `FC-trace: <FC?-N?>` in the message. Verify by re-reading commit messages. Any commit missing FC-trace? Any commit that touched `constitution.md`?
- (Q3.b) 5 cases C-071..C-075 sediment 2026-04-25 session decisions as constitutional precedent. Are the rulings standalone-readable + correctly cross-referenced?
- (Q3.c) Trust Root manifest 38 entries. Are all entries load-bearing (i.e., does tampering each one weaken the constitutional gate)?

### Q4 — Phase A → B exit decision
- (Q4.a) Spot-check: re-run `cargo test --workspace`; expect 267 PASS / 29 ignored / 0 failed.
- (Q4.b) Spot-check: re-run `python3 scripts/test_llm_proxy.py`; expect 16/16 PASS.
- (Q4.c) Spot-check: re-run `bash scripts/smoke_siliconflow.sh`; expect PASS (3/3 keys; live API; cost ~$0.005).
- (Q4.d) Are there any open P0 defects from any prior round? Cross-reference `A8_AUDIT_HISTORY_2026-04-26.md` to verify each in-cycle fix bundle's closures hold against current source.
- (Q4.e) Phase B's first sub-atom is "JSONL schema v2 + C_i full-cost aggregator" (notepad). Are there any Phase A artifacts that would BLOCK that scope?

### Q5 — Packet/history split
- (Q5.a) Is the split between `A8_EXIT_PACKET` (stable current-state) and `A8_AUDIT_HISTORY` (append-only chronology) consistent with the project's existing pattern (constitution + Art. V.3 amendment log; PREREG + PREREG_AMENDMENT; TRACE_MATRIX_v0/v1/v2)?
- (Q5.b) Is the history doc append-only — past round entries describe what was true at that round's snapshot, without retroactive edits?
- (Q5.c) Does this packet contain ANY round-N retrospective text, fix-shipped headers, "previous round caught X" claims, or historical lineage like "(post-A8e F4)" / "(added by A8eN)" / "(chain position N via A8e)" — anywhere? It should NOT — those belong only in the history doc.

---

End your audit with:
- **VERDICT**: PASS / CHALLENGE / VETO
- **Conviction**: low / medium / high
- **Recommendation**: PROCEED to Phase B (kernel instrumentation + PPUT accounting) / FIX-THEN-PROCEED / REDESIGN

PASS = current-state evidence passes Phase B prerequisites + no open P0 from prior rounds + no new substantive findings. CHALLENGE = correctable in one cycle. VETO = Phase A redesign required.
