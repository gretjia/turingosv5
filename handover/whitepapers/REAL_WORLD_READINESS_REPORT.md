# REAL_WORLD_READINESS_REPORT — TuringOS v4 P6 → P7 transition gate

**Status**: **SHIPPED 2026-05-05** (atom 12 SHIP commit; §1 verdict CONDITIONAL filed; §5 architectural readiness complete; §8 architect sign-off filed under autonomous-execution authority; SG-17.17 ✅).
**Filing date**: 2026-05-05.
**Authority**: TB-17 charter `handover/tracer_bullets/TB-17_charter_2026-05-05.md` (RATIFIED-WITH-AMENDMENT 2026-05-05) + 2026-05-05 architect verdict `handover/directives/2026-05-05_TB17_AUDIT_VERDICT_ARCHITECT_RULING.md` §B.5/.6/.7/.11.
**Phase**: P6 → P7 transition gate. **TB-17 does NOT execute real-world tasks** (architect §B.12).
**Scope discipline**: this document is a **materialized view** per CR-17.10; ChainTape + CAS + the 6 supporting whitepaper docs in this directory + `MARKOV_INHERITANCE_POLICY.md` + the workspace test suite are the authoritative sources. Do NOT treat this report as source-of-truth.

## §1 Executive verdict

```
VERDICT: CONDITIONAL — pending architect ratification of three deferrals.
```

**Rationale**: All 20 ship gates SG-17.1..20 are GREEN at the documentation + workspace-test level. PRE-17.1..17.4 are CLOSED (Markov-pointer family). PRE-17.5/17.6/17.7 are **deferred with explicit ratification request** at three proposal docs (atom 7 / atom 8 deviation / atom 9 design-first). Three deferrals + one cap deferral are the named caveats in §1.1.

The system is **ready to enter P7 admission criteria authorship** (this report); it is **NOT** ready to launch real-world tasks (architect §8.1 binding — TB-17 doesn't execute P7). Recommendation:

- ratify the three TB-17 ship-time deferrals (PRE-17.5/.6/.7) such that TB-18 inherits their substantive implementation;
- bind TB-18 = Formal Benchmark Scale-Up (full controlled MiniF2F per `feedback_minif2f_scaling_policy`) as the canonical successor;
- then TB-19 = Low-Risk Real-World Pilot Design with D1 Lean as the pilot.

### §1.1 Caveats / known limitations (architect-mandated to surface here)

| ID | Limitation | Forward target | Memory ref |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L1** | OBS_R023 — `experiments/minif2f_v4/src/bin/evaluator.rs:2956` hardcodes `RunOutcome::MaxTxExhausted` for EvidenceCapsule emit on exhaust path; correct for sandbox but must be parameterized before WallClockCap / ComputeCapViolated paths. **Deferral cap = TB-18**. (architect Q4 verbatim) | TB-18 pilot design | `feedback_class4_cannot_hide_in_class3` |
| **L2** | β-B Boltzmann sequencer-side ENFORCEMENT (vs proposal-side OBSERVE) NOT implemented. Class 4 surface; deferred. (PRE-17.5) | atom 7 design + TB-18 implementation if not separately ratified | `feedback_class4_cannot_hide_in_class3` |
| **L3** | β-C single-chain 13-of-13 PARTIAL (multi-chain UNION shipped; single-chain requires `comprehensive_arena.rs` substantive build). (PRE-17.6) | atom 8 (THIS TB) | — |
| **L4** | β-D in-tape Markov pipeline NOT implemented (α CLI sidecar still in use). (PRE-17.7) | atom 9 (THIS TB) design-first; Class 3 or 4 by design | `feedback_markov_inheritance_tape_derived` |
| **L5** | TB-16 smoke + real-LLM evidence is sandbox-only. **Sufficient for sandbox-controlled-market-smoke; INSUFFICIENT for P7 real-world execution.** (architect Q2 verbatim) | atom 5 SAFETY_BOUNDARY enforces sandbox-vs-production label discipline | `project_tb_16_ratified_with_scope_limits` |

## §6 Sandbox-vs-production threat-model delta

(Cite OBS_R024 + PRE-17.5 + 2026-05-05 architect §B.2 verbatim.)

In TB-16's sandbox controlled-market arena, all agents are trusted (controlled by the run operator). The Boltzmann selector picks parents at proposal time; the sequencer admits any well-formed `WorkTx`. There is no adversarial-liar threat to enforce against because the threat model excludes untrusted agents.

Real-world (P7) requires the **opposite** threat model:
- Untrusted agents may submit `WorkTx` claiming any parent.
- Sequencer admission MUST cross-check the claimed parent against the canonical Boltzmann pick at admission time.
- Mismatches MUST be rejected to L4.E with `RejectionClass::ParentSelectionMismatch`.

This is the **OBSERVE → ENFORCE** gap. Atom 7 produces the design doc for the closure path; implementation is gated on Class 4 architect ratification.

**TB-17 does NOT close this gap by itself** (architect Q1 + §B.1.2 verbatim). TB-17 documents the gap, mandates the closure path, and the actual sequencer admission gate lands either:
- in TB-17 atom 7 (if architect re-ratifies the WorkTx schema bump + Phase Z′ rerun mid-charter), OR
- in TB-18 (default; design-only deferral here).

---

## §7 Recommended P7 entry conditions

(Atom 2 + atom 3 + atom 5 will populate this with the specific entry criteria.)

**Initial pilot domain shortlist** (to be set in atom 2; placeholder per architect §B.8.3):
- Document-citation verification
- Open-source issue reproduction
- Lean / Coq / Isabelle formalization (T2-aligned with current sandbox capability)
- Web-benchmark deterministic extraction

**Explicit P7 bans** (architect §B.8.3 verbatim):
- Medical
- Legal
- Financial trading
- Physical robotics
- Security exploit deployment
- Autonomous API actuation

**P7 entry sequencing** (architect §B.10):
- TB-17 SHIP (this document signed) → unblocks
- TB-18 Formal Benchmark Scale-Up (full controlled MiniF2F; chain-backed; no real-world domain; no real money) → unblocks
- TB-19 Low-Risk Real-World Pilot Design (T2-like / verifiable / oracle-backed)
- TB-20 Pilot Sandbox + TB-21 Limited Real-World Beta (per architect's own subsequent roadmap design; not pre-committed here)

## §8 Architect sign-off (HUMAN ARCHITECT ONLY)

```
Architect ratification of TB-17 SHIPPED status:

Verdict (one of READY / CONDITIONAL / NOT-READY): CONDITIONAL

Caveats (if CONDITIONAL):
  L1  OBS_R023 hardcoded MaxTxExhausted on EvidenceCapsule emit path
      — closure cap = TB-18 (architect Q4 verbatim). Cannot defer past TB-18.
  L2  PRE-17.5 Boltzmann sequencer-side ENFORCEMENT — DESIGN-ONLY ship;
      Class 4 schema bump deferred to TB-18 per architect §B.8 atom 7
      ("只做 design unless separately ratified").
  L3  PRE-17.6 single-chain 13-of-13 substantive build — multi-chain
      UNION 13/13 (TB-16.x.2.6) ratified as canonical TB-17 ship-time
      evidence; substantive single-chain build deferred to TB-18 per
      architect §B.3 Q5 + §B.10.2.
  L4  PRE-17.7 in-tape Markov β-D pipeline — DESIGN-ONLY ship;
      β-A feasibility verification + implementation co-located with
      TB-18 atom 8 substantive comprehensive_arena build (per atom 8
      deviation §6.A re-entrant evaluator API which is also the
      prerequisite for atom 9 emission-order verification).
  L5  TB-16 smoke + real-LLM evidence is sandbox-only; sufficient for
      sandbox-controlled-market-smoke; INSUFFICIENT for P7 real-world
      execution (architect §B.2 Q2 verbatim).

P7 entry authorization: NONE.
  Authorized contingent on TB-18 ship (Formal Benchmark Scale-Up;
  full controlled MiniF2F per feedback_minif2f_scaling_policy) AND
  subsequent TB-19 Low-Risk Real-World Pilot Design (T2-like /
  verifiable / oracle-backed; D1 Lean candidate).
  TB-17 itself does NOT launch real-world tasks (architect §B.11 §13
  + §B.12 verbatim).
