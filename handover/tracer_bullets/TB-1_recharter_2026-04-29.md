# TB-1 Re-Charter — Days 2-7 against P0-P9 phase model (2026-04-29)

**Authority**: architect directive 2026-04-29 (`handover/directives/2026-04-29_9_phase_roadmap.md`) + user `gretjia` chat authorization. Canonical roadmap: `handover/architect-insights/ROADMAP_9_PHASE_2026-04-29.md`.

**Amended 2026-04-29 (post-audit)**: external auditor's CF-1 / CF-3 / CF-5 incorporated per `handover/audits/2026-04-29_external_audit.md` and user authorization on 2026-04-29. Specific amendments: Day-3 wording switched to L4 / L4.E split (rejected submissions go to L4.E rejection-evidence ledger, NOT to L4 with `status=rejected`); Day-2 framing sharpened (WalletTool = read-only projection of `EconomicState.balances_t`, not "legacy adapter"); Day-5 acceptance gate downgraded so P1/P3 are blocking and P6 artifacts are non-blocking until RSP-1.

**Amended 2026-04-29 — Path A++ (post Day-6 dual audit)**: Day-6 returned Codex CHALLENGE / Gemini PASS; per the conservative merge rule (VETO > CHALLENGE > PASS) this is a CHALLENGE verdict. User ruling 2026-04-29: adopt **Path A++ = narrow the ship claim + close the three lowest-cost Codex P0s + track Day-4 evidence**. Specifically:

1. **Central claim narrowed** (this section, plus § 1 GOAL, plus the Day-7 ship gate): TB-1 ships **P1/P3 RSP-0 primitives + invariant scaffolding**. TB-1 does NOT claim that the v4 runtime kernel honors L4/L4.E split — `Sequencer::dispatch_transition` is `NotYetImplemented` for all 7 K5 `TypedTx` variants and `apply_one` early-returns on transition error, so neither L4-on-accept nor L4.E-on-reject is exercised through the production path today. Runtime dispatch enforcement is **explicitly deferred to TB-2**.
2. **P0-2 closed**: a 10th Tier-A blocking test (`test_p3_rsp0_total_supply_counts_all_six_subindexes`) covers all six holding subindexes (`balances_t` + `escrows_t` + `stakes_t` + `claims_t` + `task_markets_t.bounty` + `challenge_cases_t.bond`).
3. **P0-3 closed**: `RejectedSubmissionRecord.raw_diagnostic_cid` carries `#[serde(skip_serializing, default)]`. Even if a future caller bypasses `PublicRejectionView` and serializes a raw record, the raw cid is structurally absent from the output. (Capability-gated forensic API is a TB-2/TB-3 follow-up.)
4. **P0-4 closed**: `AcceptedLedger::load_from_path` now calls `verify_chain(0, len)` BEFORE `reconstruct_state` — `prev_hash` / entry `hash` / `logical_t` row-deletion tampers that `reconstruct_state` alone misses are now caught at load time.
5. **Day-4 evidence migrated** from `/tmp/tb1_day4_smoke_v2/` to `handover/evidence/tb_1_day4_h_vppu/` (Codex P1-2). The post-hoc `h_vppu` stamping in `experiments/minif2f_v4/src/main.rs` (rather than inside `make_pput`) is registered as an **approved spec divergence**: `h_vppu` depends on history (I/O + side effect), keeping `make_pput` pure was the intentional engineering call.

Day-7 ship runs a **narrowed Codex micro-audit** (no Gemini, no large prompt) on the three closed code points. Round-2 dual audit is NOT required because Codex's CHALLENGE was about claim scope, not latent bugs.

**TB-2 candidate is renamed** from "P3 RSP-1" to **"P1/P3 Runtime Boundary Closure + RSP-1"**: primary scope is making `WorkTx` actually traverse `dispatch_transition` (accepted → L4 append; rejected → L4.E append; monetary guards as the admission/rejection oracle). RSP-1's escrow_lock_tx + yes_stake_tx ride that closure, not the other way around.

**Original charter**: commit `4ecb708` body. Original GOAL was *"One MiniF2F adaptation problem solved end-to-end at HEAD with the full v4 5-step compile loop active per-tx + economy hooks firing per-tx + L4 ledger commits per-tx + h_vppu computed in PputResult."* That goal bundled four different layer-jumps (P1 ledger, P3 economy, P5 capability compilation, P6 metric) into one 7-day TB.

**Re-charter (this doc)**: keeps Day 1 (already shipped at `063b003`); re-tags Days 2-7 against the 9-phase model; descopes one acceptance test (AT-5) that properly belongs to a P5 MetaTape TB after P3 is green.

**Charter scope**: Days 2-7 only. Day 1 is shipped and final.
**Active TB**: TB-1.
**phase_id**: P1+P3+P6 (P1 primary; P3 RSP-0 secondary; P6 instrumentation tertiary).
**Budget**: remaining of original 7 days × ≤$30 API.

---

## 1. Re-tagged GOAL

**Path A++ narrowed reading (2026-04-29, ruling)**: TB-1 ships **P1/P3 RSP-0 primitives + invariant scaffolding** as data structures + pure functions. TB-1 does NOT claim runtime dispatch enforcement; that is TB-2's primary scope.

> Discharge the **primitive scaffolding** for P1 + P3 RSP-0 by demonstrating, in unit + Tier-A integration form:
>
> 1. (P1 Exit 5,6 — *as primitives*) `AcceptedLedger::append_accepted` advances `state_root` and `logical_t`; `RejectionEvidenceWriter::append_rejected` does NOT;
> 2. (P1 Exit 7 — *as primitives*) deleting any L4 or L4.E row breaks the corresponding hash chain;
> 3. (P1 Exit 8 — *as primitives*) `AcceptedLedger::load_from_path` reconstructs the canonical `state_root` from L4 only AND verifies the chain end-to-end (P0-4 fail-closed default);
> 4. (P1 Exit 9 — *as type-shielded primitive*) `PublicRejectionView` carries no `raw_diagnostic_cid` field; `#[serde(skip_serializing)]` on `RejectedSubmissionRecord.raw_diagnostic_cid` extends that shield to direct-record serialization (P0-3);
> 5. (P3 RSP-0 Exit 1,2 — *as pure functions*) `assert_total_ctf_conserved` rejects post-init mint and unauthorized burn across ALL six holding subindexes (P0-2); `assert_read_is_free` rejects any K5 `TxKind` carrying a non-zero per-tx fee;
> 6. (P3 RSP-0 Exit 5 — *scaffolded only*) `EscrowVault::lock_escrow` / `release_escrow` exist as a minimum-viable BTreeMap; live admission of `WorkTx` against an `escrow_lock_tx` is **TB-2**, not TB-1.
> 7. (P6 instrumentation — *anchor only, non-blocking*) `h_vppu` field present and non-null on at least one row of the Day-4 live evidence at `handover/evidence/tb_1_day4_h_vppu/`.

**TB-1 explicitly does NOT prove**:

- That `Sequencer::dispatch_transition` actually CALLS the monetary guards or appends to L4/L4.E on the production path. `dispatch_transition` is `NotYetImplemented` for all 7 K5 `TypedTx` variants today and `apply_one` early-returns on transition error — runtime closure is TB-2.
- That `WorkTx` traverses an admission gate. `EscrowVault` exists as scaffolding; admission semantics live in RSP-1 (TB-2).
- That `provisional_accept` vs full payout is enforced anywhere. The `settlement_tx.payout_sum ≤ escrow_pool` exit was downgraded to TB-2 alongside the broader runtime closure.

This replaces the previous *"5-step compile loop active per-tx"* goal — step 4 (Capability Compilation) is **out of TB-1 scope** (it's P5 MetaTape work that requires a green P3).

## 2. Days 2-7 schedule (revised)

### Day 2 — P3 RSP-0: monetary invariant + on_init unique mint

**phase_id**: P3 (RSP-0 micro-version)
**Exit addressed**: P3:1, P3:2, P3:5 (`on_init` total Coin invariant; rtool/think don't deduct; escrow required for market admission)
**Kill tested**: P3:1 (post-init mint MUST fail), P3:2 (stakeless write MUST fail)

**Build**:
- `src/economy/monetary_invariant.rs` — module exposing:
  - `pub fn assert_no_post_init_mint(tx: &TypedTx, q: &QState) -> Result<(), MonetaryError>`
  - `pub fn assert_total_ctf_conserved(before: &EconomicState, after: &EconomicState, exempt_tx_kinds: &[TxKind]) -> Result<(), MonetaryError>`
  - `pub fn assert_read_is_free(tx_kind: TxKind, fee: u64) -> Result<(), MonetaryError>` (rtool/search/think MUST have fee=0)
- `src/economy/escrow_vault.rs` — minimum-viable BTreeMap<TaskId, EscrowEntry>:
  - `pub fn lock_escrow(task_id, sponsor, amount) -> EscrowReceipt`
  - `pub fn release_escrow(task_id, payout_map) -> Result<(), EscrowError>` (asserts sum ≤ amount before release)
- Unit tests: post-init mint rejected; total CTF conserved across N=10 random tx sequences; escrow over-payout rejected; escrow under-payout accepted (residual returns to sponsor).

**FROZEN today**: `src/sdk/tools/wallet.rs` (STEP_B-protected); `kernel.rs`; `bus.rs`; `genesis_payload.toml [trust_root]` constitution_root entry.

**WalletTool framing (sharpened post-audit 2026-04-29 CF-3)**: `src/sdk/tools/wallet.rs` is **NOT a legacy mutable adapter** — it is a *read-only projection* of `QState.economic_state_t.balances_t`. Mutations to economic state happen exclusively through the canonical RSP path (`SettlementEngine` / `EscrowVault` / `StakeManager` / `monetary_invariant`). No new RSP code may depend on `WalletTool.credit()` or on `WalletTool` mutating its `HashMap<String, f64>` to represent canonical balance state. Existing `WalletTool` tests stay temporarily as legacy behavior tests; they get removed or rewritten as RSP-1/RSP-2 lands.

**Acceptance signal**: `cargo test -p turingosv4 economy::` ≥ 6 tests green; running 1 evaluator shot still produces JSONL row (no regression in P6 capability path).

### Day 3 — P1 GitTape Kernel hardening

**phase_id**: P1
**Exit addressed**: P1:5 (state_root advances on accept), P1:6 (state_root unchanged on reject), P1:7 (ledger hash chain), P1:8 (state.db reconstruction), P1:9 (rejected-log isolation)
**Kill tested**: P1:1 (no wtool bypass), P1:2 (rejected tx ≠ state_root advance), P1:3 (state.db reconstructable), P1:4 (no read-view pollution)

**Build** (post-audit 2026-04-29 CF-1: TWO ledgers, not one):
- `src/economy/ledger.rs` — minimum-viable accepted-only L4 wrapper around the existing `src/bottom_white/ledger/transition_ledger.rs`. Provides:
  - `pub fn append_accepted(tx: &TypedTx) -> Result<LedgerEntry, LedgerError>` — content-addressed, prev_hash chained, advances `logical_t`.
  - `pub fn verify_chain(start: usize, end: usize) -> Result<(), ChainError>` — L4 hash chain integrity.
  - `pub fn reconstruct_state(state_path: &Path) -> Result<QState, ReconstructError>` — replays L4 only (L4.E NOT consulted; rejections must not affect `state_root`).
- `src/bottom_white/ledger/rejection_evidence.rs` (NEW, post-audit 2026-04-29 CF-1): minimum-viable rejection-evidence ledger:
  - `RejectedSubmissionRecord` struct with `submit_id`, `parent_state_root`, `agent_id`, `tx_kind`, `tx_payload_cid`, `rejection_class`, `raw_diagnostic_cid` (Option), `public_summary` (Option), `prev_hash`, `hash`.
  - `RejectionEvidenceWriter::append_rejected()` returns the new chain hash.
  - `verify_chain()` returns `Err` on row deletion.
  - **No `logical_t`** — uses `submit_id` instead.
  - **No `state_root` advance** — `dispatch_transition` rejection path MUST NOT mutate `q.state_root_t` or `q.ledger_root_t`.
- 5 P1-kill acceptance tests (re-tagged post-audit):
  - `test_p1_kill_1_no_wtool_bypass`: any direct mutation to state.db without going through wtool→L4 panics or fails to round-trip via `reconstruct_state`.
  - `test_p1_kill_2_rejected_tx_no_state_advance`: simulate a tx that fails predicate; assert `state_root` unchanged; assert **L4 logical_t NOT incremented**; assert **L4.E `submit_id`-scoped record IS appended** (one record, raw_diagnostic_cid populated).
  - `test_p1_kill_3_ledger_reconstructable`: drop state.db; reconstruct from L4 only; bit-equal to pre-drop `state_root`. L4.E intentionally not consulted in reconstruction.
  - `test_p1_kill_4_rejected_log_isolated`: emit a rejected tx with diagnostic content; assert another Agent's materialized read view does NOT contain the raw diagnostic (only an aggregate counter or `public_summary` is permitted).
  - `test_p1_kill_4b_rejection_chain_breaks_on_row_deletion`: write 3 rejection-evidence records; delete row 2; `RejectionEvidenceWriter::verify_chain()` returns `Err(RejectionEvidenceError::HashMismatch { at: 2 })`.
- 1 L4 hash-chain acceptance test:
  - `test_p1_exit_7_l4_chain_breaks_on_row_deletion`: write 5 accepted L4 entries; delete row 3; `verify_chain(0, 5)` returns `Err(ChainError::HashMismatch { at_index: 3 })`.

**FROZEN**: same as Day 2 + the new monetary_invariant.rs (no further edits today).

**Acceptance signal**: 5 new tests green; running 1 evaluator shot now writes ≥1 ledger row per tx; verify the hash chain holds across the run.

### Day 4 — P6 instrumentation: h_vppu computation

**phase_id**: P6 (Epistemic Lab v0 product-line metric)
**Exit addressed**: P6:7 (falsification-tracking metric: h_vppu reflects per-problem repeated-attempt regression; runs that re-attempt a problem with no learning have h_vppu=0)
**Kill tested**: none directly — P6 product-line metric only

**Build**:
- `experiments/minif2f_v4/src/h_vppu_history.rs` (new) — minimum-viable per-problem rolling history:
  - `pub struct HVppuHistory { /* problem_id → VecDeque<f64> with capacity 3 */ }`
  - `pub fn record(problem_id, pput_verified) -> ()`
  - `pub fn h_vppu_for(problem_id, current_pput_verified) -> Option<f64>` (returns `current / mean(history N=1..3)` if at least 1 prior run; else None)
- Wire into `make_pput`: pass history reference; stamp `h_vppu` field on result.
- (Optional, time permitting) upgrade `prompt_context_hash` from DefaultHasher 16-char to SHA-256 64-char; same commit re-hashes Trust Root manifest entry. **Out of TB-1 scope if Day 4 budget tight**; defer to TB-2 cleanup.

**FROZEN**: same as Days 2-3 (P3 monetary_invariant, P1 ledger, all STEP_B files).

**Acceptance signal**: 2 new evaluator runs of mathd_algebra_107 in n3 mode produce JSONL rows where the second row has `h_vppu` ≠ None; `cargo test` h_vppu_history unit tests ≥ 3 green.

### Day 5 — Acceptance test battery (5 original + 6 new)

**phase_id**: P1+P3 (battery integration)
**Exit addressed**: cumulative — every Exit listed in Days 2-3
**Kill tested**: cumulative — every Kill listed in Days 2-3

**Build** — `tests/tb_1_acceptance.rs` (new):

**Tier A — BLOCKING (P1 + P3 RSP-0 correctness; TB-1 ship requires ALL Tier-A tests green):**

1. **(P1 kill 1)** `test_p1_kill_1_no_wtool_bypass` — direct state mutation outside wtool fails.
2. **(P1 kill 2)** `test_p1_kill_2_rejected_tx_no_state_advance` — `state_root` unchanged; L4 `logical_t` NOT incremented; L4.E `submit_id`-scoped record appended.
3. **(P1 kill 3)** `test_p1_kill_3_ledger_reconstructable` — drop state.db; reconstruct from L4 only; bit-equal pre-drop `state_root`.
4. **(P1 kill 4)** `test_p1_kill_4_rejected_log_isolated` — raw L4.E diagnostic NOT in another Agent's materialized view (only aggregate / public_summary).
5. **(P1 Exit 7)** `test_p1_exit_7_l4_chain_breaks_on_row_deletion`.
6. **(P1 kill 4b)** `test_p1_kill_4b_rejection_chain_breaks_on_row_deletion` — L4.E hash chain integrity.
7. **(P3 RSP-0 Exit 1)** `test_p3_rsp0_exit_1_on_init_total_invariant` — `total_coin(EconomicState)` sum invariant across N tx sequence.
8. **(P3 RSP-0 Exit 2)** `test_p3_rsp0_exit_2_read_is_free` — `assert_read_is_free(fee=0)` for `rtool` / `search` / `think`; non-zero fee returns `MonetaryError::ReadCharged`.
9. **(P3 kill 1)** `test_p3_kill_1_no_post_init_mint` — any post-`on_init` `mint_tx` returns `MonetaryError::PostInitMint`; rejection MUST be in L4.E, not L4.

**Tier B — NON-BLOCKING (P6 Epistemic Lab anchor evidence + future-RSP placeholders; TB-1 ship does NOT require these green; they are artifacts to capture, not gates):**

10. **(original AT-1, post-audit downgrade per CF-5)** evaluator runs n3 swarm on mathd_algebra_107 → solved=true. **Non-blocking**: this is P6 anchor smoke; TB-1's mission is P1/P3 correctness, not capability regression. If P6 regresses, file as a separate P6 anchor TB; it does NOT block TB-1 ship.
11. **(original AT-2, post-audit re-tag)** each tx in the run produces an L4 `LedgerEntry` committed via `Git2LedgerWriter` (or the new `src/economy/ledger.rs`); rejected proposals appear in L4.E. **Non-blocking** for TB-1 ship — until WorkTx `dispatch_transition` body lands (TB-1 Day-3 minimum WorkTx slice or later TB), the evaluator path may continue using its own legacy emit path. The L4 / L4.E assertions are evaluated against synthetic test inputs in Tier-A tests #2/3/5, not against the live evaluator run.
12. **(original AT-3, post-audit re-tag)** `PputResult.h_vppu` non-null on a 2nd-run row. **Non-blocking**: P6 instrumentation; useful artifact but not a P1/P3 gate.
13. **(original AT-4, post-audit downgrade per CF-3)** `PputResult.econ_balance_delta` non-zero. **Non-blocking until RSP-1**: RSP-0 (Day-2) only proves the conservation invariant + scaffolds escrow/balances structures; actual non-zero deltas require RSP-1's `escrow_lock_tx` + `yes_stake_tx` to fire, which lives in TB-2.
14. ~~**(original AT-5)**~~ **DESCOPED**: "second attempt of same problem in same session uses 1st attempt's winning tactic in prompt context" properly belongs to P5 MetaTape v1 (ArchitectAI proposal flow). Filed for a future TB after P3 RSP-3 green. Not part of TB-1 ship gate.

**Acceptance signal** (post-audit 2026-04-29 CF-5 lighter option): TB-1 ships when **all Tier-A tests (1-9) green**. Tier-B tests (10-13) are captured as artifacts but do not gate ship. If any Tier-A kill test goes RED → STOP TB-1; write `OBS_TB-1_FAILED_2026-04-29.md`; charter must change before retry. Kill-with-OBS NOT permitted on Tier-A.

### Day 6 — Dual external audit (executed; CHALLENGE/PASS → CHALLENGE merged)

**Codex + Gemini parallel** with focus = "do these 10 tests prove the claimed P1/P3 RSP-0 properties?" — not spec wording. Apply VETO > CHALLENGE > PASS conservatism per `feedback_dual_audit_conflict`.

**Result (2026-04-29)**: Codex CHALLENGE / Gemini PASS → merged CHALLENGE per the conservative rule. See `handover/audits/DUAL_AUDIT_TB_1_VERDICT_2026-04-29.md`. Path A++ patch set (P0-2 / P0-3 / P0-4 + Day-4 evidence migration + claim narrowing) addresses Codex's three lowest-cost P0s; Codex P0-1 (runtime enforcement) is intentionally NOT addressed in TB-1 — it is the primary scope of TB-2.

### Day 7 — Ship (Path A++ narrowed)

Day-7 ship runs:

1. **Codex micro-audit** (no Gemini, no large prompt) on three closed questions:
   - Does Tier-A now cover all six `EconomicState` holding subindexes (P0-2)?
   - Does `raw_diagnostic_cid` now fail closed under raw-record serialization (P0-3)?
   - Does `AcceptedLedger::load_from_path` now reject `prev_hash` / entry-`hash` / row-deletion tampers (P0-4)?
2. If micro-audit returns PASS on the three closed points: ship.
3. **Ship commit must use the narrowed claim verbatim**: "TB-1 ships P1/P3 RSP-0 primitives and invariant scaffolding; runtime enforcement deferred to TB-2." NOT: "the v4 GitTape kernel honors the L4/L4.E split."

On ship:

- TB_LOG.tsv: TB-1 row → status=`shipped`; capability_metric updated to reference `handover/evidence/tb_1_day4_h_vppu/run2.jsonl` (`h_vppu=6.215891726697228`, deepseek-chat, mathd_algebra_107, n3) and explicitly tag `runtime_enforcement=deferred_TB2`; ship_commits range filled.
- Post the **renamed TB-2 candidate to user**: **TB-2 = P1/P3 Runtime Boundary Closure + RSP-1**. Primary scope: real `WorkTx` traversing `dispatch_transition` (accepted → L4; rejected → L4.E; monetary guards as the admission/rejection oracle). RSP-1's `escrow_lock_tx` + `yes_stake_tx` ride that closure, not the other way around.

If Day-6 returns VETO:

- Write `handover/alignment/OBS_TB-1_FAILED_2026-04-29.md` with diagnosis layer (P1 / P3 / P6 instrumentation / charter scope).
- Revert OR keep-with-OBS (NOT for kill criteria; only for Exit-criteria coverage gaps).
- Charter MUST change before retry.

## 3. Out-of-scope items moved to future TBs

| Original AT | Reason | Future home |
|---|---|---|
| AT-5 (winning-tactic in prompt context) | Step-4 Capability Compilation = P5 MetaTape, requires P3 RSP-3 green first | TB-N (P5 MetaTape v1; post-P3-RSP-3) |
| SHA-256 upgrade for prompt_context_hash | Touches Cargo.lock + Trust Root re-hash; cleanest in a dedicated cleanup TB | TB-2 cleanup or TB-3 P5 prep |
| Per-tx FC events for every economy mutation | Belongs in P4 Information Loom signal-routing TB | TB-N (P4 v0) |

## 4. Things this re-charter does NOT change

- Day 1 (shipped at `063b003`) — final, no rewind.
- TB-1 budget — same 7 days × ≤$30 API as original charter.
- The 5 frozen files per TB-1 ship surface (`evaluator.rs`, `jsonl_schema.rs`, `src/economy/ledger.rs` [new], `tests/tb_1_acceptance.rs` [new], TB_LOG.tsv) — same surface; Day 2 adds `src/economy/monetary_invariant.rs` + `src/economy/escrow_vault.rs` to the surface, both new files (no STEP_B file edited).
- 24h iteration cap (memory `feedback_iteration_cap_24h`) — every Day must produce evaluator pass/fail signal within 24h.
- Trust Root protocol (R-014 + R-018) — unchanged; any new file going into the manifest follows the established hash-update protocol.

## 5. Acceptance for re-charter itself

The re-charter ships when:

- This doc is committed.
- TB_LOG.tsv reflects the new column schema with TB-1 phase_id correctly tagged.
- AUTO_RESEARCH_NOTEPAD.md TB methodology v2 references this doc.
- Day 2 work begins with the new `src/economy/monetary_invariant.rs` skeleton.

The re-charter is reverted if any of:

- User retracts the P0-P9 ordering authorization (no expected trigger).
- Day 2 monetary_invariant tests reveal that `on_init` mint-only is silently bypassed by an existing code path (would be a P0 ALREADY-FAILED kill criterion → escalate before continuing).
