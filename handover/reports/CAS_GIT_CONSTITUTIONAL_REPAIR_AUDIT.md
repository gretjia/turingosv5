# CAS Git Constitutional Repair Audit

Date: 2026-05-17

Worktree: `/home/zephryj/projects/turingosv4-cas-git-repair`

Branch: `codex/cas-git-constitutional-repair`

No `turingos_dev` was used for this repair. Main was not merged.

## Executive Summary

This branch repairs the CAS Git authority path and closes the auditor
`CHALLENGE` blockers.

The most important correction is factual: the 18 red constitution gates in the
repair worktree were not treated as harmless "pre-existing red gates." They
were reproduced as a branch/worktree blocker at `c85dacfa`, then closed by:

- hydrating ignored historical fixture `cas/` and `runtime_repo/` directories
  from the main worktree into the isolated repair worktree;
- preserving readability of legacy sidecar + blob-ref CAS evidence while still
  failing closed on invalid non-commit CAS refs;
- fixing the TB-18R R9 expected-count postprocess so synthetic preseed Work is
  excluded and `step_partial_ok` is counted from structured JSON;
- refreshing `R9_BATCH_SUMMARY.json` after v4 invariant postprocess;
- adding a branch-local Class 4 §8 directive for the Trust Root rehash.

Final constitution gates are green:

```text
bash scripts/run_constitution_gates.sh
Totals: 461 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored
PASS: all gates GREEN.
```

Final broad workspace tests also pass:

```text
cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast -- --test-threads=1
exit 0
```

## Risk And FC Mapping

Risk class:

- Class 3 for CAS integrity and evidence storage.
- Class 4 only for the user-authorized Trust Root rehash.

Class 4 directive:

- `handover/directives/2026-05-17_CAS_GIT_CONSTITUTIONAL_REPAIR_§8_TRUST_ROOT_RATIFICATION.md`

Allowed Class 4 scope:

- `Cargo.lock`
- `Cargo.toml`
- `src/runtime/evidence_capsule.rs`
- `src/bottom_white/cas/mod.rs`
- `src/bottom_white/cas/store.rs`
- `src/bottom_white/cas/git_chain.rs`
- `src/bottom_white/ledger/transition_ledger.rs`
- `src/state/sequencer.rs`
- `genesis_payload.toml`

Forbidden and not touched:

- `src/state/typed_tx.rs`
- `src/bottom_white/cas/schema.rs`
- `src/kernel.rs`
- `src/bus.rs`
- `src/sdk/tools/wallet.rs`
- canonical signing payloads
- sequencer admission policy
- constitution/flowchart text
- main merge

FC mapping:

- FC1: CAS/evidence writes and ChainTape binding.
- FC2: replay/audit boot from CAS Git chain and cache rebuild.
- FC3: archived evidence feedback, report/audit materialized views, and raw-log
  compression/readback.

## Implementation

CAS Git chain:

- `Cid = sha256(content)` is unchanged.
- New writes make `refs/chaintape/cas` point at a CAS commit-chain head, not a
  latest blob OID.
- CAS commit records carry CID, backend blob OID, object metadata, previous CAS
  root, resulting Merkle root, object type, schema id, creator, and logical
  time.
- `.turingos_cas_index.jsonl` is cache-only when a CAS chain exists.
- Missing sidecar rebuilds from the CAS Git chain.
- Sidecar mismatch against the chain fails closed.
- CAS ref update failure fails `put`.
- Legacy blob-ref + matching sidecar evidence can open and upgrades to a CAS
  commit head on the next forward `put`.
- Invalid non-commit refs without the legacy sidecar condition still fail
  closed.

EvidenceCapsule compression:

- New raw logs are gzip-stored in CAS.
- Manifest records compression algorithm, raw size, stored size, and
  uncompressed sha256.
- Historical uncompressed evidence remains readable.

R9 postprocess:

- `handover/tests/scripts/tb_18r_expected_from_pput.py` computes expected
  completed attempts from structured PPUT JSON.
- Formula:
  `step_reject + parse_fail + llm_err + sorry_block + omega_wtool + complete + complete_via_tape + step_partial_ok`.
- Synthetic `tb6-smoke-agent` preseed Work is excluded to match chain-side
  counting.
- `tb_18r_postprocess_invariant_v4.sh` now refreshes `R9_BATCH_SUMMARY.json`
  after recomputing per-problem invariants.

Historical fixture hydration:

- Manifest:
  `handover/reports/CAS_GIT_REPAIR_HYDRATION_MANIFEST.md`
- Hydrated only ignored `cas/` and `runtime_repo/` trees.
- Hydrated directories do not appear in `git status --short`.
- Historical evidence bytes were not rewritten.

Fresh-checkout CI fixtures:

- Compact real evidence fragments are tracked under
  `handover/evidence/ci_fixtures/`.
- They cover only the historical ignored CAS/runtime fragments required by
  constitution gates in a clean checkout:
  TB-C0 capsule CAS, M0 P01 L4.E body-integrity evidence, and Wave3 50p CAS
  sidecars.
- Tests prefer full local historical evidence when present and extract these
  fixtures only when the ignored `cas/` / `runtime_repo/` trees are absent.
- A separate scratch worktree at `da747c52` reproduced the GitHub fresh-checkout
  failures before the fixtures and passed full constitution gates after the
  fixture patch.

REAL13 note:

- No available local worktree had a root-level ignored REAL13 `cas/` artifact.
- `constitution_librarian_real_evidence_binding` now binds to tracked
  `aggregate_verdict.json` CAS-derived metrics and checks local sidecar only
  when present.

## Clean-Context Audit

Final clean-context Codex audit:

- `handover/audits/CODEX_CAS_GIT_REPAIR_FINAL_CLEAN_CONTEXT_AUDIT.md`
- Verdict: `PROCEED`

The reviewer found no blocking production defect and independently verified the
main CAS repair surfaces, forbidden-surface boundaries, Trust Root tests, CAS
store tests, EvidenceCapsule tests, R9 helper/summary tests, and constitution
gates. The only note was a P3 evidence packaging issue where the R9
per-problem README materialized views still showed pre-v4-postprocess
invariant excerpts. Those README files were refreshed after the audit to match
the authoritative `chain_invariant.json` and `R9_BATCH_SUMMARY.json`
`delta=0 / Ok` evidence.

## Real-Problem Evidence

The repair worktree has no `.env`. Real-problem runs sourced
`/home/zephryj/projects/turingosv4/.env` read-only; secrets were not copied into
the repair worktree.

Mini evidence:

- Path:
  `handover/evidence/cas_git_repair_challenge_final_20260517T095728Z/`
- Command:
  `TURINGOS_G_PHASE_DIRTY_OK=1 bash scripts/run_g_phase_batch.sh cas_git_repair_challenge_final_20260517T095728Z mini`
- Elapsed: `60s`
- `batch_exit=0`
- `audit_verdict=PROCEED`
- `persistence_passing=true`
- `persistence_n_witnessed=5`
- Logical CAS objects from audit: `66`
- CAS disk: `2.2M`
- Runtime repo disk: `1.2M`
- Git CAS object files: `330`

R9 evidence:

- Path:
  `handover/evidence/cas_git_repair_challenge_final_r9_20260517T100600Z/`
- Command:
  `OUT_DIR=... MAX_TX=12 PER_PROBLEM_TIMEOUT_S=1800 bash handover/tests/scripts/run_tb_18r_r9_evidence.sh`
- Raw per-problem `audit_tape`: `PROCEED` for both problems.
- Postprocess:
  `bash handover/tests/scripts/tb_18r_postprocess_invariant_v4.sh handover/evidence/cas_git_repair_challenge_final_r9_20260517T100600Z`
- Postprocess result: `PASS=2 FAIL=0 NA=0`
- `python3 -m json.tool .../R9_BATCH_SUMMARY.json`: PASS

R9 per-problem final invariants:

| Problem | Duration | Audit | Expected | L4 | L4E | Capsule anchored | Delta | Verdict | CAS disk | Runtime disk | Logical CAS objects |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `P01_mathd_numbertheory_1124` | 121s | PROCEED | 6 | 1 | 5 | 0 | 0 | Ok | 1.8M | 564K | 49 |
| `P02_numbertheory_2pownm1prime_nprime` | 716s | PROCEED | 8 | 0 | 5 | 3 | 0 | Ok | 2.1M | 440K | 58 |

Combined final real-evidence storage:

- Logical CAS objects: `173` (`66 + 49 + 58`)
- Git CAS object files: `865` (`330 + 245 + 290`)

## Efficiency Comparison

Improved:

- Core constitution gates improved from the reproduced CHALLENGE baseline
  `446/18/1` to `461/0/1`; the count also reflects removal of five MiniF2F
  development package tests from the core OS gate and addition of the two-test
  boundary gate.
- R9 P02 invariant improved from historical red (`delta=8` under the old
  expected-count view) to `delta=0 / Ok`.
- GitHub/fresh-checkout constitution gates no longer depend on local ignored
  hydration for the TB-C0, Wave3, and M0 evidence fragments used by the
  existing gates.
- CAS metadata is reconstructable from Git commit history instead of relying
  on sidecar as authority.
- New EvidenceCapsule raw logs are compressed and hash-verifiable.
- CAS ref failure and CAS integrity read failures now fail closed.

Equivalent by design:

- `Cid = sha256(content)` is unchanged.
- Old evidence bytes are not rewritten.
- `src/bottom_white/cas/schema.rs` and typed transaction schema are unchanged.
- Normal hot path still uses in-memory `BTreeMap`.

Regressions / cost:

- CAS commit-chain metadata adds Git objects for each CAS put. This is an
  intentional auditability cost.
- The tracked CI fixtures add about 431 KiB of compact binary test evidence to
  the repository. The full hydrated historical directories remain ignored.
- MiniF2F is no longer part of the root workspace or the core constitution
  gate runner. It remains available as explicit development/benchmark
  validation via `--manifest-path experiments/minif2f_v4/Cargo.toml`; this
  branch does not claim MiniF2F package tests as fixed TuringOS kernel gates.
- MiniF2F now has its own opt-in `experiments/minif2f_v4/Cargo.lock` so its
  dependency lock is isolated from the TuringOS root workspace lock.
- The heavy MiniF2F run binaries are marked `test = false` so opt-in
  package tests do not link evaluator binaries as test harnesses. Explicit
  real-run `--bin evaluator` / `--bin batch_evaluator` builds remain available.
- Active non-pinned MiniF2F run scripts touched by this repair use explicit
  `--manifest-path` plus `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`; historical trust-root-pinned
  preregistration scripts were left unchanged to avoid expanding the Class 4
  rehash scope.
- First run after `cargo clean` required release/debug rebuild time.

Not comparable:

- Original baseline real-problem metrics were skipped by preflight because the
  repair worktree lacked `.env`. The final real-problem runs are therefore
  reported as final evidence, not as an apples-to-apples runtime speedup claim.

## Post-PR P1 Challenge Closure

After PR #3 was opened, review returned `NO` because `CasStore::put()` advanced
the CAS commit-chain before sidecar cache refresh while readers
`open()`/`reload_index_from_sidecar()` did not take the same lock. A reader
could therefore observe a healthy in-flight write as a hard
`CAS sidecar cache mismatch with CAS commit-chain` corruption.

Fix:

- Added regression test
  `open_waits_for_inflight_cas_chain_cache_refresh`.
- Verified RED before the fix:
  `cargo test --lib open_waits_for_inflight_cas_chain_cache_refresh -- --nocapture`
  failed because the reader did not wait for the CAS chain lock.
- Minimal production change:
  `open()` and `reload_index_from_sidecar()` now load sidecar+chain under the
  same CAS chain lock used by `put()`. The `put()` hot path keeps its existing
  lock and calls the unlocked loader internally to avoid self-deadlock.
- Tampered sidecars still fail closed when no writer lock is active.
- No change to `Cid = sha256(content)`, `src/bottom_white/cas/schema.rs`,
  typed transaction schema, canonical signing payload, or sequencer admission.
- The P1 closure rehashed only the already-pinned
  `src/bottom_white/cas/store.rs` entry under the CAS Git repair Class 4 scope;
  the later core/experiment boundary closure rehashed root `Cargo.toml` and
  `Cargo.lock` after removing MiniF2F from the default workspace.

Post-fix local evidence:

- `cargo test --lib open_waits_for_inflight_cas_chain_cache_refresh -- --nocapture`:
  `1 passed / 0 failed`.
- `cargo test --lib bottom_white::cas::store::tests -- --test-threads=1`:
  `35 passed / 0 failed`.
- `CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$PWD/target" cargo test --manifest-path experiments/minif2f_v4/Cargo.toml --test trust_root_immutability -- --test-threads=1`:
  `4 passed / 0 failed`.
- Original CAS repair targeted suite:
  `34 passed / 0 failed`.
- `bash scripts/run_constitution_gates.sh`:
  `461 passed / 0 failed / 1 ignored`.

Post-fix CI/fresh-checkout closure:

- GitHub PR #3 then failed the Constitution gate suite at
  `441 passed / 18 failed / 1 ignored` because the CI checkout did not contain
  ignored historical `cas/` / `runtime_repo/` fixture directories.
- The failing families matched the earlier hydration blocker:
  FC3 capsule integrity, shielding evidence binding, FC3 evidence binding, and
  L4.E body integrity.
- Added the smallest tracked real-evidence fixture archives under
  `handover/evidence/ci_fixtures/` and changed the affected tests to extract
  those archives only when the original ignored evidence fragments are absent.
- Verified in a detached scratch worktree without local hydration:
  `bash scripts/run_constitution_gates.sh` -> `464 passed / 0 failed / 1 ignored`.

Post-review core/experiment gate boundary closure:

- After the fixture closure, GitHub passed the evidence-binding families but
  still failed the package gate
  `minif2f_v4::constitution_g1_2_subprocess_resume`.
- The failure was not a test assertion. The enhanced gate log showed Rust
  1.95 `rust-lld` crashing with `Bus error` while linking the heavy
  `evaluator` / `batch_evaluator` binaries during `cargo test -p minif2f_v4`.
- User clarification on 2026-05-17 states that MiniF2F is a development
  benchmark corpus, not a fixed TuringOS kernel or OS gate. Therefore the fix
  is to remove the `minif2f_v4` package test from
  `scripts/run_constitution_gates.sh` and remove `experiments/minif2f_v4` from
  the root workspace.
- Added `constitution_minif2f_boundary`, which failed before the fix because
  active runner lines invoked `minif2f_v4`; it now also asserts that root
  workspace members exclude the MiniF2F experiment package.
- Intentional MiniF2F scripts now use explicit `--manifest-path
  experiments/minif2f_v4/Cargo.toml` plus `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` to preserve
  existing release binary paths without making MiniF2F a default workspace
  member. This was limited to active non-pinned scripts; trust-root-pinned
  historical preregistration scripts were left unchanged.
- Retained `experiments/minif2f_v4/Cargo.toml` `test = false` flags for the
  heavy run binaries as experiment-package test resource isolation.
- Local verification:
  `cargo test --test constitution_minif2f_boundary -- --test-threads=1` ->
  `2 passed / 0 failed`; full core gates -> `461 passed / 0 failed / 1 ignored`.

## Residual Risks And Non-Claims

- Full historical ignored fixture directories remain untracked. This branch
  only packages the minimal real fragments required by current constitution
  gates in clean checkout / CI.
- REAL13 has no root-level local ignored CAS sidecar in available worktrees; the
  fixed test binds to tracked aggregate CAS metrics and optional local sidecar
  when present.
- No change is claimed to sequencer admission policy, typed transaction schema,
  canonical signing payloads, constitution, or flowcharts.
- No merge to main is performed by this branch.
- The earlier clean-context Codex audit returned `PROCEED`, but it predates
  the PR #3 P1 review challenge and this closure patch. Merge remains blocked
  until GitHub CI is green and the PR auditor re-reviews the updated branch.

## Merge Guidance

Before merge:

1. Review the Class 4 §8 directive and Trust Root hash comments.
2. Confirm no forbidden surfaces appear in the final diff.
3. Confirm PR #3 GitHub CI is green after the P1 and CI-fixture closure
   commits.
4. Require auditor re-review of the P1 closure and fresh-checkout fixture
   closure before merging.
5. Do not merge local hydrated ignored historical fixture dirs; only the compact
   tracked `handover/evidence/ci_fixtures/` archives are part of this branch.
