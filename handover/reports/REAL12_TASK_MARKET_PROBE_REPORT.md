# REAL-12 Task-Market Action Probe Report

REAL-17 main-CAS integration note: this report is preserved as historical
market-autonomy context from the older pre-CAS-repair worktree. The evidence
paths below are not present in this new main-based worktree and are not
forward claim-bearing for REAL-17. New claim-bearing market-emergence evidence
must be regenerated on the updated CAS Git commit-chain baseline.

## Interpretation Boundary

Historical pre-repair label only:

`E2 candidate pending audit`

This probe tests whether the advertised task-level market action affordance
causes live agents to emit `bid_task` or `invest`. It does not force trades,
does not enable live REAL-6B, and does not allow price to affect Lean predicates.

Scripted actions cannot satisfy E2. A live non-scripted router tx requires
ChainTape/CAS evidence, PromptCapsule/trace provenance, and audit_tape PROCEED.
This report derives EconomicJudgment counts from CAS schema
`real12.economic_judgment.v1` and Bull/Bear turn coverage from
`real5.role_turn_trace.v1`; stdout tool_dist is diagnostic only.
