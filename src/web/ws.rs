/// TRACE_MATRIX FC1-N5: real-time read-view push channel
///
/// WebSocket handler for TuringOS Phase 7 W2/W4.
///
/// W4 migration: `WsEnvelope` is now a tagged-union enum (serde tag = "msg_type")
/// with two variants:
///   - `IrUpdate { view, ir }`:    initial push on connect + IR change broadcasts
///   - `TaskCreated { task_id, agent_id, problem_id, bounty }`: write-path event
///
/// Design: `WsEnvelope<'a>` covers both variants for serialization. The broadcast
/// channel uses the owned `WsBroadcastMsg` type (only `TaskCreated` is broadcast;
/// `IrUpdate` is pushed inline on initial connect). The socket send path serializes
/// both `WsEnvelope` (for initial pushes) and `WsBroadcastMsg` (for broadcasts)
/// as the same JSON shape via `serde`.
///
/// `AppState` carries a `tokio::sync::broadcast::Sender<WsBroadcastMsg>` threaded
/// through axum's State extractor. The `/ws` handler subscribes on connect; the
/// POST /api/task/open handler sends on success.
///
/// W2 behaviour preserved: on upgrade, server still pushes three `IrUpdate`
/// envelopes immediately (one per view).
///
/// Receive loop policy (unchanged from W2):
///   Ping   → reply Pong
///   Text   → log only (client-driven state mutation via WS is not supported)
///   Binary → log only
///   Close  → break loop, clean shutdown
///   Err    → log and break
