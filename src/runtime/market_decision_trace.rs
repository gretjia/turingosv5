//! TB-N3 A2 (architect ruling 2026-05-11 §8.1 + §8.2 + §8.6) — agent invest
//! decision audit trail.
//!
//! Every agent emission of `{"tool":"invest", ...}` produces a
//! `MarketDecisionTrace` CAS object recording: agent identity, the prompt
//! `=== Market ===` block hash that informed the decision, the visible
//! candidate node ids, the chosen node + direction + amount + quoted price
//! (if any), and a `TraceOutcome` that distinguishes:
//!
//! - `Submitted{tx_id}` — the invest payload was constructed into a
//!   `BuyWithCoinRouterTx` and submitted; downstream `tx_id` is the L4 / L4.E
//!   anchor.
//! - `NoTrade{reason}` — pre-submit classification rejected the payload
//!   (zero amount, missing pool, balance shortfall, malformed node, etc.);
//!   no on-chain tx is constructed; trace lives in CAS only.
//! - `Declined` — agent emitted invest with `amount = 0` AS A SIGNAL of
//!   declination (vs. NoTrade::ZeroAmount which is parser-induced); kept
//!   distinct so the no-trade-reason aggregate report can separate
//!   "agent chose not to trade" from "system rejected agent attempt".
//!
//! Constitutional binding:
//! - Architect §8.6 "Failed invest 也算有意义 tape activity" — failed invests
//!   that actually constructed a tx anchor in L4.E; pre-submit failures
//!   anchor in CAS via this trace.
//! - Architect §8.1 "MarketDecisionTrace" — externalized market-decision
//!   audit (NOT private CoT; the agent's market-side decision is a
//!   first-class L4.E-or-trace-bearing action, not an internal monologue).
//! - Architect §8.2 "No-trade reason report" — `NoTradeReason` enum is the
//!   canonical taxonomy aggregated in `audit_dashboard --run-report` §F.
//!
//! Replay determinism: the trace is constructed from inputs the
//! evaluator already has (snapshot Q + agent action + candidate list).
//! No clock or randomness in the trace itself; storage layer (CasStore)
//! provides content-addressing.
